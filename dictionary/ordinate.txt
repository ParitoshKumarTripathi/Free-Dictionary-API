ORDINATE

Or"di*nate, n. (Geom.)

Defn: The distance of any point in a curve or a straight line,
measured on a line called the axis of ordinates or on a line parallel
to it, from another line called the axis of abscissas, on which the
corresponding abscissa of the point is measured.

Note: The ordinate and abscissa, taken together, are called
coördinates, and define the position of the point with reference to
the two axes named, the intersection of which is called the origin of
coördinates. See Coordinate.
