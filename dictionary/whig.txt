Whig, n. Etym: [Said to be from whiggam, a term used in Scotland in
driving horses, whiggamore one who drives horses (a term applied to
some western Scotchmen), contracted to whig. In 1648, a party of
these people marched to Edinburgh to oppose the king and the duke of
Hamilton (the Whiggamore raid), and hence the name of Whig was given
to the party opposed to the court. Cf. Scot. whig to go quickly.]

1. (Eng. Politics)

Defn: One of a political party which grew up in England in the
seventeenth century, in the reigns of Charles I. and II., when great
contests existed respecting the royal prerogatives and the rights of
the people. Those who supported the king in his high claims were
called Tories, and the advocates of popular rights, of parliamentary
power over the crown, and of toleration to Dissenters, were, after
1679, called Whigs. The terms Liberal and Radical have now generally
superseded Whig in English politics. See the note under Tory.
