CASTANETS
Cas"ta*nets, n. pl. Etym: [F. castagnettes, Sp. castañetas, fr. L.
castanea (Sp. castaña) a chestnut. So named from the resemblance to
two chestnuts, or because chestnuts were first used for castanets.
See Chestnut.]

Defn: Two small, concave shells of ivory or hard wood, shaped like
spoons, fastened to the thumb, and beaten together with the middle
finger; -- used by the Spaniards and Moors as an accompaniment to
their dance and guitars.

Note: The singular, castanet, is used of one of the pair, or,
sometimes, of the pair forming the instrument.
The dancer, holding a castanet in each hand, rattles then to the
motion of his feet. Moore (Encyc. of Music).
