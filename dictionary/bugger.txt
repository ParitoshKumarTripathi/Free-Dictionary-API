BUGGER
Bug"ger, n. Etym: [F. bougre, fr. LL. Bulgarus, a Bulgarian, and also
a heretic; because the inhabitants of Bulgaria were infected with
heresy. Those guilty of the crime of buggery were called heretics,
because in the eyes of their adversaries there was nothing more
heinous than heresy, and it was therefore thought that the origin of
such a vice could only be owing to heretics.]

1. One guilty of buggery or unnatural vice; a sodomite.

2. A wretch; -- sometimes used humorously or in playful
disparagement. [Low]
