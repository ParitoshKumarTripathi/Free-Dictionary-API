DESPOND
De*spond", v. i. [imp. & p. p. Desponded; p. pr. & vb. n.
Desponding.] Etym: [L. despond, desponsum, to promise away, promise
in marriage, give up, to lose (courage); de- + spond to promise
solemnly. See Sponsor.]

Defn: To give up, the will, courage, or spirit; to be thoroughly
disheartened; to lose all courage; to become dispirited or depressed;
to take an unhopeful view.
I should despair, or at least despond. Scott's Letters.

difficulty. Locke.
We wish that . . . desponding patriotism may turn its eyes
hitherward, and be assured that foundations of our national power
still stand strong. D. Webster.

Syn.
 -- Despond, Dispair. Despair implies a total loss of hope, which
despond does not, at least in every case; yet despondency is often
more lasting than despair, or than desperation, which impels to
violent action.
