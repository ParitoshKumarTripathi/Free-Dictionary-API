MALIC
Ma"lic, a. Etym: [L. malum an apple: cf. F. malique.] (Chem.)

Defn: Pertaining to, or obtained from, apples; as, malic acid. Malic
acid, a hydroxy acid obtained as a substance which is sirupy or
crystallized with difficulty, and has a strong but pleasant sour
taste. It occurs in many fruits, as in green apples, currants, etc.
It is levorotatory or dextrorotatory according to the temperature and
concentration. An artificial variety is a derivative of succinic
acid, but has no action on polarized light, and thus malic acid is a
remarkable case of physical isomerism.
