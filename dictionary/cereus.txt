CEREUS
Ce"re*us, n. Etym: [L., a wax candle, fr. cera wax. So named from the
resemblance of one species to the columnar shape of a wax candle.]
(Bot.)

Defn: A genus of plants of the Cactus family. They are natives of
America, from California to Chili.

Note: Although several species flower in the night, the name Night-
blooming cereus is specially applied to the Cereus grandiflorus,
which is cultivated for its beautiful, shortlived flowers. The Cereus
giganteus, whose columnar trunk is sometimes sixty feet in height, is
a striking feature of the scenery of New Mexico, Texas, etc.
