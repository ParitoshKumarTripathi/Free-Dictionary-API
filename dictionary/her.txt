HER
Her, pron. & a. Etym: [OE. hire, here, hir, hure, gen. and dat.
sing., AS. hire, gen. and dat. sing. of héo she. from the same root
as E. he. See He.]

Defn: The form of the objective and the possessive case of the
personal pronoun she; as, I saw her with her purse out.

Note: The possessive her takes the form hers when the noun with which
in agrees is not given, but implied. "And what his fortune wanted,
hers could mend." Dryden.
