Ep"i*trite, n. Etym: [Gr. i. e., , or in the ratio of 4 to 3);
epitritos, F. Ã©pitrite.] (Gr. & Lat. Pros.)

Defn: A foot consisting of three long syllables and one short
syllable.

Note: It is so called from being compounded of a spondee (which
contains 4 times) with an iambus or a trochee (which contains 3
times). It is called 1st, 2d, 3d, or 4th epitrite according as the
short syllable stands 1st, 2d, etc.
