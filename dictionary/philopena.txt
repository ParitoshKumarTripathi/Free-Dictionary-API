PHILOPENA
Phil`o*pe"na, n. Etym: [Probably a corruption fr. G. vielliebchen,
LG. vielliebken, or D. veelliebken, a philopena, literally, much
loved; but influenced by Gr. poena penalty, from an idea that the
gift was a penalty of friendship or love.]

Defn: A present or gift which is made as a forfeit in a social game
that is played in various ways; also, the game itself. [Written also
fillipeen and phillippine.]

Note: One of the ways may be stated as follows: A person finding a
nut with two kernels eats one, and gives the other to a person of the
opposite sex, and then whichever says philopena first at the next
meeting wins the present. The name is also applied to the kernels
eaten.
