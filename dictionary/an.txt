AN
An. Etym: [AS. an one, the same word as the numeral. See One, and cf.
A.]

Defn: This word is properly an adjective, but is commonly called the
indefinite article. It is used before nouns of the singular number
only, and signifies one, or any, but somewhat less emphatically. In
such expressions as "twice an hour," "once an age," a shilling an
ounce (see 2d A, 2), it has a distributive force, and is equivalent
to each, every.

Note: An is used before a word beginning with a vowel sound; as, an
enemy, an hour. It in also often used before h sounded, when the
accent of the word falls on the second syllable; as, an historian, an
hyena, an heroic deed. Many writers use a before h in such positions.
Anciently an was used before consonants as well as vowels.
