PUTREFACTION
Pu`tre*fac"tion, n. Etym: [L. putrefactio: cf. F. putréfaction. See
Putrefy.]

1. The act or the process of putrefying; the offensive decay of
albuminous or other matter.

Note: Putrefaction is a complex phenomenon involving a multiplicity
of chemical reactions, always accompanied by, and without doubt
caused by, bacteria and vibriones; hence, putrefaction is a form of
fermentation, and is sometimes called putrefaction fermentative.
Putrefaction is not possible under conditions that preclude the
development of living organisms. Many of the products of putrefaction
are powerful poisons, and are called cadaveric poisons, or ptomaïnes.

2. The condition of being putrefied; also, that which putrefied.
"Putrefaction's breath." Shelley.
