RHOMB
Rhomb, n. Etym: [L. rhombus, Gr. wrench: cf. F. rhombe. Cf. Rhombus,
Rhumb.]

1. (Geom.)

Defn: An equilateral parallelogram, or quadrilateral figure whose
sides are equal and the opposite sides parallel. The angles may be
unequal, two being obtuse and two acute, as in the cut, or the angles
may be equal, in which case it is usually called a square.

2. (Geom.)

Defn: A rhombohedron. Fresnel's rhomb (Opt.), a rhomb or oblique
parallelopiped of crown or St. Gobain glass so cut that a ray of
light entering one of its faces at right angles shall emerge at right
angles at the opposite face, after undergoing within the rhomb, at
other faces, two reflections. It is used to produce a ray circularly
polarized from a plane-polarized ray, or the reverse. Nichol.
