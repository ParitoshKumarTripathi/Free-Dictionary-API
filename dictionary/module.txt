2. (Arch.)

Defn: The size of some one part, as the diameter of semi-diameter of
the base of a shaft, taken as a unit of measure by which the
proportions of the other parts of the composition are regulated.
Generally, for columns, the semi-diameter is taken, and divided into
a certain number of parts, called minutes (see Minute), though often
the diameter is taken, and any dimension is said to be so many
modules and minutes in height, breadth, or projection.
