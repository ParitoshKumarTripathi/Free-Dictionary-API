COMFREY
Com"frey, n. Etym: [Prob. from F. conferve, L. conferva, fr.
confervere to boil together, in medical language, to heal, grow
together. So called on account of its healing power, for which reason
it was also called consolida.] (Bot.)

Defn: A rough, hairy, perennial plant of several species, of the
genus Symphytum.

Note: A decoction of the mucilaginous root of the "common comfrey"
(S. officinale) is used in cough mixtures, etc.; and the gigantic
"prickly comfrey" (S. asperrimum) is somewhat cultivated as a forage
plant.
