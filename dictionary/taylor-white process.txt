TAYLOR-WHITE PROCESS
Tay"lor-White" proc`ess. (Metal.)

Defn: A process (invented about 1899 by Frederick W. Taylor and
Maunsel B. White) for giving toughness to self-hardening steels. The
steel is heated almost to fusion, cooled to a temperature of from
700º to 850º C. in molten lead, further cooled in oil, reheated to
between 370º and 670º C., and cooled in air.
