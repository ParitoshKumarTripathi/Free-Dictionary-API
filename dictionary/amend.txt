Syn.
 -- To Amend, Emend, Correct, Reform, Rectify. These words agree in
the idea of bringing things into a more perfect state. We correct
(literally, make straight) when we conform things to some standard or
rule; as, to correct proof sheets. We amend by removing blemishes,
faults, or errors, and thus rendering a thing more a nearly perfect;
as, to amend our ways, to amend a text, the draft of a bill, etc.
Emend is only another form of amend, and is applied chiefly to
editions of books, etc. To reform is literally to form over again, or
put into a new and better form; as, to reform one's life. To rectify
is to make right; as, to rectify a mistake, to rectify abuses,
inadvertencies, etc.
