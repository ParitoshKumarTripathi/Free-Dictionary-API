Nun"ci*o, n.; pl. Nuncios. Etym: [It. nunzio, nuncio, fr. L. nuncius,
nuntius, messenger; perh. akin to novus new, E. new, and thus, one
who brings news. Cf. Announce.]

1. A messenger. [Obs.] Shak.

court or seat of government. Distinguished from a legate a latere,
whose mission is temporary in its nature, or for some special
purpose. Nuncios are of higher rank than internuncios.
