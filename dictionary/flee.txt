FLEE
Flee, v. i. [imp. & p. p. Fled; p. pr. & vb. n. Fleeing.] Etym: [OE.
fleon, fleen, AS. fleón (imperf. fleáh); akin to D. vlieden, OHG. &
OS. fliohan, G. fliehen, Icel. fl (imperf. fl), Dan. flye, Sw. fly
(imperf. flydde), Goth. pliuhan. (Flight.]

Defn: To run away, as from danger or evil; to avoid in an alarmed or
cowardly manner; to hasten off; -- usually with from. This is
sometimes omitted, making the verb transitive.
[He] cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. Shak.
Flee fornication. 1 Cor. vi. 18.
So fled his enemies my warlike father. Shak.

Note: When great speed is to be indicated, we commonly use fly, not
flee; as, fly hence to France with the utmost speed. "Whither shall I
fly to 'scape their hands" Shak. See Fly, v. i., 5.
