Waive, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Waived; p. pr. & vb. n. Waiving.] Etym:
[OE. waiven, weiven, to set aside, remove, OF. weyver, quesver, to
waive, of Scand. origin; cf. Icel. veifa to wave, to vibrate, akin to
Skr. vip to tremble. Cf. Vibrate, Waif.] [Written also wave.]

1. To relinquish; to give up claim to; not to insist on or claim; to
refuse; to forego.
He waiveth milk, and flesh, and all. Chaucer.
We absolutely do renounce or waive our own opinions, absolutely
yielding to the direction of others. Barrow.

2. To throw away; to cast off; to reject; to desert.

3. (Law)
(a) To throw away; to relinquish voluntarily, as a right which one
may enforce if he chooses. (b) (O. Eng. Law)

Defn: To desert; to abandon. Burrill.

Note: The term was applied to a woman, in the same sense as outlaw to
a man. A woman could not be outlawed, in the proper sense of the
word, because, according to Bracton, she was never in law, that is,
in a frankpledge or decennary; but she might be waived, and held as
abandoned. Burrill.
