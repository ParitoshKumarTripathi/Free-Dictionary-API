XANTHIN
Xan"thin, n. [Gr. xanqo`s yellow.]

1. (Physiol. Chem.) A crystalline nitrogenous body closely related to
both uric acid and hypoxanthin, present in muscle tissue, and
occasionally found in the urine and in some urinary calculi. It is
also present in guano. So called from the yellow color of certain of
its salts (nitrates).

2. (Chem.) A yellow insoluble coloring matter extracted from yellow
flowers; specifically, the coloring matter of madder.  [Formerly
written also xanthein.]

3. (Chem.) One of the gaseous or volatile decomposition products of
the xanthates, and probably identical with carbon disulphide.  [Obs.]
