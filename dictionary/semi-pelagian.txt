Defn: A follower of John Cassianus, a French monk (died about 448),
who modified the doctrines of Pelagius, by denying human merit, and
maintaining the necessity of the Spirit's influence, while, on the
other hand, he rejected the Augustinian doctrines of election, the
inability of man to do good, and the certain perseverance of the
saints.
