Mol`lus*coi"de*a, n. pl. Etym: [NL. See Mollusk, and -oid.] (Zoöl.)

Defn: A division of Invertebrata which includes the classes
Brachiopoda and Bryozoa; -- called also Anthoid Mollusca.

Note: Originally the Tunicata were included under Molluscoidea, from

Molluscoidea were formerly considered a subdivision of Mollusca, but
they are now known to have more relationship with Annelida than with
Mollusca.
