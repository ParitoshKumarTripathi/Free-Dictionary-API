INDIVISIBLE

=====
In`di*vis"i*ble, n.

1. That which is indivisible.
By atom, nobody will imagine we intend to express a perfect
indivisible, but only the least sort of natural bodies. Digby.

2. (Geom.)

Defn: An infinitely small quantity which is assumed to admit of no
further division. Method of indivisibles, a kind of calculus,
formerly in use, in which lines were considered as made up of an
infinite number of points; surfaces, as made up of an infinite number
of lines; and volumes, as made up of an infinite number of surfaces.
