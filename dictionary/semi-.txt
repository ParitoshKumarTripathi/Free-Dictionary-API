SEMI-
Sem"i-. Etym: [L. semi; akin to Gr. sami-, AS. sam-, and prob. to E.
same, from the division into two parts of the same size. Cf. Hemi-,
Sandelend.]

Defn: A prefix signifying half, and sometimes partly or imperfectly;
as, semiannual, half yearly; semitransparent, imperfectly
transparent.

Note: The prefix semi is joined to another word either with the
hyphen or without it. In this book the hyphen is omitted except
before a capital letter; as, semiacid, semiaquatic, semi-Arian,
semiaxis, semicalcareous.
