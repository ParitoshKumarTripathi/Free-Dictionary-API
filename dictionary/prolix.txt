PROLIX
Pro*lix", a. Etym: [L. prolixus extended, long, prolix, probably fr.
pro before, forward + liqui to flow, akin to liquidus liquid; cf. OL.
lixa water: cf. F. prolixe. See Liquid.]

1. Extending to a great length; unnecessarily long; minute in
narration or argument; excessively particular in detail; -- rarely
used except with reference to discourse written or spoken; as, a
prolix oration; a prolix poem; a prolix sermon.
With wig prolix, down flowing to his waist. Cowper.

2. Indulging in protracted discourse; tedious; wearisome; -- applied
to a speaker or writer.

Syn.
 -- Long; diffuse; prolonged; protracted; tedious; tiresome;
wearisome.
 -- Prolix, Diffuse. A prolix writer delights in circumlocution,
extended detail, and trifling particulars. A diffuse writer is fond
of amplifying, and abounds in epithets, figures, and illustrations.
Diffuseness often arises from an exuberance of imagination; prolixity
is generally connected with a want of it.
