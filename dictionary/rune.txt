RUNE
Rune (run), n. Etym: [AS. run a rune, a secret, a mystery; akin to
Icel. run, OHG. & Goth. runa a secret, secret colloquy, G. & Dan.
rune rune, and probably to Gr. 'ereyna^n to search for. Cf. Roun to
whisper.]

1. A letter, or character, belonging to the written language of the
ancient Norsemen, or Scandinavians; in a wider sense, applied to the
letters of the ancient nations of Northern Europe in general.

Note: The Norsemen had a peculiar alphabet, consisting of sixteen
letters, or characters, called runes, the origin of which is lost in
the remotest antiquity. The signification of the word rune (mystery)
seems to allude to the fact that originally only a few were
acquainted with the use of these marks, and that they were mostly
applied to secret tricks, witchcrafts and enchantments. But the runes
were also used in communication by writing.

2. pl.

Defn: Old Norse poetry expressed in runes.

Rune stone, a stone bearing a runic inscription.
