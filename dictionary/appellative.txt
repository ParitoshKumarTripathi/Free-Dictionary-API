Ap*pel"la*tive, n. Etym: [L. appelativum, sc. nomen.]

1. A common name, distinction from a proper name. A common name, or
appellative, stands for a whole class, genus, or species of beings,
or for universal ideas. Thus, tree is the name of all plants of a
particular class; plant and vegetable are names of things that grow
out of the earth. A proper name, on the other hand, stands for a
single thing; as, Rome, Washington, Lake Erie.

2. An appellation or title; a descriptive name.
God chosen it for one of his appellatives to be the Defender of them.
Jer. Taylor.
