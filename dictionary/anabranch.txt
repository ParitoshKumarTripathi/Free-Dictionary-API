ANABRANCH
An"a*branch, n. [Anastomosing + branch.]

Defn: A branch of a river that reënters, or anastomoses with, the
main stream; also, less properly, a branch which loses itself in
sandy soil. [Australia]

Such branches of a river as after separation reunite, I would term
anastomosing branches; or, if a word might be coined, anabranches,
and the islands they form branch islands.
