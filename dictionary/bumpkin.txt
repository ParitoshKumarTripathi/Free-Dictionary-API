BUMPKIN
Bump"kin, n. Etym: [The same word as bumkin, which Cotgrave defines
thus: "Bumkin, Fr. chicambault, the luffe-block, a long and thick
piece of wood, whereunto the fore-sayle and sprit-sayle are fastened,
when a ship goes by the winde." Hence, a clumsy man may easily have
been compared to such a block of wood; cf. OD. boomken a little tree.
See Boom a pole.]

Defn: An awkward, heavy country fellow; a clown; a country lout.
"Bashful country bumpkins." W. Irving.
