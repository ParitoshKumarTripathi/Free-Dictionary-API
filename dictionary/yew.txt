Yew, n. Etym: [OE. ew, AS. eów, iw, eoh; akin to D. ijf, OHG. iwa,
iha, G. eibe, Icel. ; cf. Ir. iubhar, Gael. iubhar, iughar, W. yw,
ywen, Lith. jëva the black alder tree.]

1. (Bot.)

Defn: An evergreen tree (Taxus baccata) of Europe, allied to the
pines, but having a peculiar berrylike fruit instead of a cone. It
frequently grows in British churchyards.

2. The wood of the yew. It is light red in color, compact, fine-
grained, and very elastic. It is preferred to all other kinds of wood
for bows and whipstocks, the best for these purposes coming from
Spain.

Note: The American yew (Taxus baccata, var. Canadensis) is a low and
straggling or prostrate bush, never forming an erect trunk. The
California yew (Taxus brevifolia) is a good-sized tree, and its wood
is used for bows, spear handles, paddles, and other similar
implements. Another yew is found in Florida, and there are species in
Japan and the Himalayas.

3. A bow for shooting, made of the yew.
