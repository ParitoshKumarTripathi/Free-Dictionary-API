Het`e*ro*ne*re"is, n. Etym: [NL. See Hetero-, and Nereis.] (Zoöl.)

Defn: A free-swimming, dimorphic, sexual form of certain species of
Nereis.

Note: In this state the head and its appendages are changed in form,
the eyes become very large; more or less of the parapodia are highly
modified by the development of finlike lobes, and branchial lamellæ,
and their setæ become longer and bladelike.
