OBSIDIAN
Ob*sid"i*an, n. Etym: [L. Obsidianus lapis, so named, according to
Pliny, after one Obsidius, who discovered it in Ethiopia: cf.F.
obsidiane, obsidienne. The later editions of Pliny read Obsianus
lapis, and Obsius, instead of Obsidianus lapis, and Obsidius.] (Min.)

Defn: A kind of glass produced by volcanoes. It is usually of a black
color, and opaque, except in thin splinters.

Note: In a thin section it often exhibits a fluidal structure, marked
by the arrangement of microlites in the lines of the flow of the
molten mass.
