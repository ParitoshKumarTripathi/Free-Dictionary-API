NEITHER

=====
Nei"ther, conj.

Defn: not either; generally used to introduce the first of two or
more coördinate clauses of which those that follow begin with nor.
Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king. 1 Kings
xxii. 31.
Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent, Neither had I
transgressed, nor thou with me. Milton.
When she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor
give, nor lose it. Shak.

Note: Neither was formerly often used where we now use nor. "For
neither circumcision, neither uncircumcision is anything at all."
Tyndale. "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it." Gen.
iii. 3. Neither is sometimes used colloquially at the end of a clause
to enforce a foregoing negative (nor, not, no). "He is very tall, but
not too tall neither." Addison. " `I care not for his thrust' `No,
nor I neither.'" Shak. Not so neither, by no means. [Obs.] Shak.
