LARVA
Lar"va, n.; pl. L. Larvæ, E. Larvas. Etym: [L. larva ghost, specter,
mask.]

1. (Zoöl.)

Defn: Any young insect from the time that it hatches from the egg
until it becomes a pupa, or chrysalis. During this time it usually
molts several times, and may change its form or color each time. The
larvæ of many insects are much like the adults in form and habits,
but have no trace of wings, the rudimentary wings appearing only in
the pupa stage. In other groups of insects the larvæ are totally
unlike the parents in structure and habits, and are called
caterpillars, grubs, maggots, etc.

2. (Zoöl.)

Defn: The early, immature form of any animal when more or less of a
metamorphosis takes place, before the assumption of the mature shape.
