NECROMANCY
Nec"ro*man`cy, n. Etym: [OE. nigromaunce, nigromancie, OF.
nigromance, F. nécromance, nécromancie, from L. necromantia, Gr.
necare to kill, Skr. na() to perish, vanish) + mania. See Mania, and
cf. Internecine, Noxious. The old spelling is due to confusion with
L. niger black. Hence the name black art.]

Defn: The art of revealing future events by means of a pretended
communication with the dead; the black art; hence, magic in general;
conjuration; enchantment. See Black art.
This palace standeth in the air, By necromancy placèd there. Drayton.
