ALLURE
Al*lure", v. t. [imp. & p. p. Alluded; p. pr. & vb. n. Alluring.]
Etym: [OF. aleurrer, alurer, fr. a (L. ad) + leurre lure. See Lure.]

Defn: To attempt to draw; to tempt by a lure or bait, that is, by the
offer of some good, real or apparent; to invite by something
flattering or acceptable; to entice; to attract.
With promised joys allured them on. Falconer.
The golden sun in splendor likest Heaven Allured his eye. Milton.

Syn.
 -- To attract; entice; tempt; decoy; seduce.
 -- To Allure, Entice, Decoy, Seduce. These words agree in the idea
of acting upon the mind by some strong controlling influence, and
differ according to the image under which is presented. They are all
used in a bad sense, except allure, which has sometimes (though
rarely) a good one. We are allured by the prospect or offer (usually
deceptive) of some future good. We are commonly enticed into evil by
appeals to our passions. We are decoyed into danger by false
appearances or representations. We are seduced when drawn aside from
the path of rectitude. What allures draws by gentle means; what
entices leads us by promises and persuasions; what decoys betrays us,
as it were, into a snare or net; what seduces deceives us by artful
appeals to the passions.
