esp. as compared with the mass and volume of a portion of some
substance used as a standard.

Note: For gases the standard substance is hydrogen, at a temperature
of 0º Centigrade and a pressure of 760 millimeters. For liquids and
solids the standard is water at a temperature of 4º Centigrade. The
density of solids and liquids is usually called specific gravity, and
the same is true of gases when referred to air as a standard.
