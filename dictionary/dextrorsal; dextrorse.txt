DEXTRORSAL; DEXTRORSE
Dex*tror"sal, Dex"trorse`, a. Etym: [L. dextrorsum, contr. fr.
dextrovorsum, dextroversum, toward the right side; dexter right +
versus, vorsus, p. p. of vertere, vortere, to turn.]

Defn: Turning from the left to the right, in the ascending line, as
in the spiral inclination of the stem of the common morning-gl√≥ry.

Note: At present scientists predicate dextrorse or sinistrorse
quality of the plant regarded objectively; formerly the plant was
regarded subjectively, and what is now called dextrorse was then
considered sinistrorse.
