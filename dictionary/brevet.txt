Bre*vet", n. Etym: [F. brevet, LL. brevetum, fr. L. brevis short. See
Brief.]

1. A warrant from the government, granting a privilege, title, or
dignity. [French usage].

2. (Mil.)

Defn: A commission giving an officer higher rank than that for which
he receives pay; an honorary promotion of an officer.

Note: In the United States army, rank by brevet is conferred, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, for "gallant actions or
meritorious services." A brevet rank gives no right of command in the
particular corps to which the officer brevetted belongs, and can be
exercised only by special assignment of the President, or on court
martial, and detachments composed of different corps, with pay of the
brevet rank when on such duty.
