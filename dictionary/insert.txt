INSERT
In*sert", v. t. [imp. & p. p. Inserted; p. pr. & vb. n. Inserting.]
Etym: [L. insertus, p. p. of inserere to insert; pref. in- in +
serere to join, connect. See Series.]

Defn: To set within something; to put or thrust in; to introduce; to
cause to enter, or be included, or contained; as, to insert a scion
in a stock; to insert a letter, word, or passage in a composition; to
insert an advertisement in a newspaper.
These words were very weakly inserted where they will be so liable to
misconstruction. Bp. Stillingfleet.
