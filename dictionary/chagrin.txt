Syn.
 -- Vexation; mortification; peevishness; fretfulness; disgust;
disquiet. Chagrin, Vexation, Mortification. These words agree in the
general sense of pain produced by untoward circumstances. Vexation is
a feeling of disquietude or irritating uneasiness from numerous
causes, such as losses, disappointments, etc. Mortification is a
stronger word, and denotes that keen sense of pain which results fron
wounded pride or humiliating occurrences. Chagrin is literally the
cutting pain produced by the friction of Shagreen leather; in its
figurative sense, it varies in meaning, denoting in its lower degrees
simply a state of vexation, and its higher degrees the keenest sense
of mortification. "Vexation arises chiefly fron our wishes and views
being crossed: mortification, from our self-importance being hurt;
chagrin, from a mixture of the two." Crabb.
