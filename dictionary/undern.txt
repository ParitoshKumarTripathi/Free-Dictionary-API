UNDERN
Un"dern, n. Etym: [AS. undern; akin to OS. undorn, OHG. untarn,
untorn, Icel. undorn mid afternoon, mid forenoon, Goth. unda√∫rnimats
the midday meal. Cf. Undermeal, Undertime.]

Defn: The time between; the time between sunrise and noon;
specifically, the third hour of the day, or nine o'clock in the
morning, according to ancient reckoning; hence, mealtime, because
formerly the principal meal was eaten at that hour; also, later, the
afternoon; the time between dinner and supper. [Obs. or Prov. Eng.]
Betwixt undern and noon was the field all won. R. of Brunne.
In a bed of worts still he lay Till it was past undern of the day.
Chaucer.
