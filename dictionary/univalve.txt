UNIVALVE
U"ni*valve, n. Etym: [Uni- + valve: cf. F. univalve.] (Zo√∂l.)

Defn: A shell consisting of one valve only; a mollusk whose shell is
composed of a single piece, as the snails and conchs.

Note: Most univalves are spiral and are the shells of gastropods, but
many belong to cephalopods and pteropods. A large number of univalves
belonging to the gastropods are conical, cup-shaped, or shieldlike,
as the limpets.
