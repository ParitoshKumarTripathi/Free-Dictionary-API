PUTATIVE
Pu"ta*tive, a. Etym: [L. putativus, fr. putare, putatum, to reckon,
suppose, adjust, prune, cleanse. See Pure, and cf. Amputate, Compute,
Dispute, Impute.]

Defn: Commonly thought or deemed; supposed; reputed; as, the putative
father of a child. "His other putative (I dare not say feigned)
friends." E. Hall.
Thus things indifferent, being esteemed useful or pious, became
customary, and then came for reverence into a putative and usurped
authority. Jer. Taylor.
