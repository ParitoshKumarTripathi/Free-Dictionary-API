LAMPREY
Lam"prey, n. ; pl. Lampreys. Etym: [OE. lampreie, F. lamproie, LL.
lampreda, lampetra, from L. lambere to lick + petra rock, stone. The
lampreys are so called because they attach themselves with their
circular mouths to rocks and stones, whence they are also called
rocksuckers. See Lap to drink, Petrify.] (Zoöl.)

Defn: An eel-like marsipobranch of the genus Petromyzon, and allied
genera. The lampreys have a round, sucking mouth, without jaws, but
set with numerous minute teeth, and one to three larger teeth on the
palate (see Illust. of Cyclostomi). There are seven small branchial
openings on each side. [Written also lamper eel, lamprel, and
lampron.]

Note: The common or sea lamprey of America and Europe (Petromyzon
marinus), which in spring ascends rivers to spawn, is considered
excellent food by many, and is sold as a market fish in some
localities. The smaller river lampreys mostly belong to the genus
Ammocoeles, or Lampetra, as A. fluviatilis, of Europe, and A.
æpypterus of America. All lampreys attach themselves to other fishes,
as parasites, by means of the suckerlike mouth.
