UNCONFORMITY
Un`con*form"i*ty, n.

1. Want of conformity; incongruity; inconsistency. South.

2. (Geol.)

Defn: Want of parallelism between strata in contact.

Note: With some authors unconformity is equivalent to
unconformability; but it is often used more broadly, for example, to
include the case when the parallelism of strata once conformable has
been disturbed by faulting and the like.
