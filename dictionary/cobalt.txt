COBALT
Co"balt (; 277, 74), n. Etym: [G. kobalt, prob. fr. kobold, kobel,
goblin, MHG. kobolt; perh. akin to G. koben pigsty, hut, AS. cofa
room, cofgodas household gods, Icel. kofi hut. If so, the ending -old
stands for older -walt, -wald, being the same as -ald in E. herald
and the word would mean ruler or governor in a house, house spirit,
the metal being so called by miners, because it was poisonous and
troublesome. Cf. Kobold, Cove, Goblin.]
