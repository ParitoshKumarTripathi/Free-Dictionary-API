UNLESS
Un*less", conj. Etym: [Formerly, onles, onlesse, onlesse that, that
is, in less, in a less case. See On, and Less.]

Defn: Upon any less condition than (the fact or thing stated in the
sentence or clause which follows); if not; supposing that not; if it
be not; were it not that; except; as, we shall fail unless we are
industrious.

Note: By the omission of the verb in the dependent clause, unless was
frequently used prepositionally, -- a construction common in
Shakespeare and still employed colloquially.
Here nothing breeds unless the nightly owl. Shak.
