CARNOT'S CYCLE
Car`not's" cy"cle. [After N. L. S. Carnot, French physicist.]
(Thermodynamics)

Defn: An ideal heat-engine cycle in which the working fluid goes
through the following four successive operations: (1) Isothermal
expansion to a desired point; (2) adiabatic expansion to a desired
point; (3) isothermal compression to such a point that (4) adiabatic
compression brings it back to its initial state.
