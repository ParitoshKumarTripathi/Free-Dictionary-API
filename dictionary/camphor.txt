Note: The name camphor is also applied to a number of bodies of
similar appearance and properties, as cedar camphor, obtained from
the red or pencil cedar (Juniperus Virginiana), and peppermint
camphor, or menthol, obtained from the oil of peppermint. Camphor oil
(Chem.), name variously given to certain oil-like products, obtained
especially from the camphor tree.
 -- Camphor tree, a large evergreen tree (Cinnamomum Camphora) with
lax, smooth branches and shining triple-nerved lanceolate leaves,
probably native in China, but now cultivated in most warm countries.
Camphor is collected by a process of steaming the chips of the wood
and subliming the product.
