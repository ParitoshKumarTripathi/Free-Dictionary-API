An orderly life so far as others are able to observe us is now and
then produced by prudential motives or by dint of habit; but without
seriousness there can be no religious principle at the bottom, no
course of conduct from religious motives; in a word, there can be no
religion. Paley.

different tribes, nations, or communities, and based on the belief
