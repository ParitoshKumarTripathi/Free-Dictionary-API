RHYME
Rhyme, n. Etym: [OE. ryme, rime, AS. rim number; akin to OHG. rim
number, succession, series, G. reim rhyme. The modern sense is due to
the influence of F. rime, which is of German origin, and originally
the same word.] [The Old English spelling rime is becoming again
common. See Note under Prime.]

1. An expression of thought in numbers, measure, or verse; a
composition in verse; a rhymed tale; poetry; harmony of language.
"Railing rhymes." Daniel.
A ryme I learned long ago. Chaucer.
He knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rime. Milton.

2. (Pros.)

Defn: Correspondence of sound in the terminating words or syllables
of two or more verses, one succeeding another immediately or at no
great distance. The words or syllables so used must not begin with
the same consonant, or if one begins with a vowel the other must
begin with a consonant. The vowel sounds and accents must be the
same, as also the sounds of the final consonants if there be any.
For rhyme with reason may dispense, And sound has right to govern
sense. Prior.

3. Verses, usually two, having this correspondence with each other; a
couplet; a poem containing rhymes.

4. A word answering in sound to another word. Female rhyme. See under
Female.
