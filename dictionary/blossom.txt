BLOSSOM
Blos"som, n. Etym: [OE. blosme, blostme, AS. bl, bl, blossom; akin to
D. bloesem, L. fios, and E. flower; from the root of E. blow to
blossom. See Blow to blossom, and cf. Bloom a blossom.]

1. The flower of a plant, or the essential organs of reproduction,
with their appendages; florescence; bloom; the flowers of a plant,
collectively; as, the blossoms and fruit of a tree; an apple tree in
blossom.

Note: The term has been applied by some botanists, and is also
applied in common usage, to the corolla. It is more commonly used
than flower or bloom, when we have reference to the fruit which is to
succeed. Thus we use flowers when we speak of plants cultivated for
ornament, and bloom in a more general sense, as of flowers in
general, or in reference to the beauty of flowers.
Blossoms flaunting in the eye of day. Longfellow.

2. A blooming period or stage of development; something lovely that
gives rich promise.
In the blossom of my youth. Massinger.

3. The color of a horse that has white hairs intermixed with sorrel
and bay hairs; -- otherwise called peach color. In blossom, having
the blossoms open; in bloom.
