Defn: A common baptismal name for a man. The name of one of the
apostles, Peter boat, a fishing boat, sharp at both ends, originally
of the Baltic Sea, but now common in certain English rivers.
 -- Peter Funk, the auctioneer in a mock auction. [Cant, U.S.] --
Peter pence, or Peter's pence. (a) An annual tax or tribute, formerly
paid by the English people to the pope, being a penny for every
house, payable on Lammas or St.Peter's day; -- called also Rome scot,
and hearth money. (b) In modern times, a voluntary contribution made
by Roman Catholics to the private purse of the pope.
 -- Peter's fish (Zoöl.), a haddock; -- so called because the black

similar spots.
