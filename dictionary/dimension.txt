DIMENSION
Di*men"sion, n. Etym: [L. dimensio, fr. dimensus, p. p. of dimetiri
to measure out; di- = dis- + metiri to measure: cf. F. dimension. See
Measure.]

1. Measure in a single line, as length, breadth, height, thickness,
or circumference; extension; measurement; -- usually, in the plural,
measure in length and breadth, or in length, breadth, and thickness;
extent; size; as, the dimensions of a room, or of a ship; the
dimensions of a farm, of a kingdom.
Gentlemen of more than ordinary dimensions. W. Irving.
Space of dimension, extension that has length but no breadth or
thickness; a straight or curved line.
 -- Space of two dimensions, extension which has length and breadth,
but no thickness; a plane or curved surface.
 -- Space of three dimensions, extension which has length, breadth,
and thickness; a solid.
 -- Space of four dimensions, as imaginary kind of extension, which
is assumed to have length, breadth, thickness, and also a fourth
imaginary dimension. Space of five or six, or more dimensions is also
sometimes assumed in mathematics.

2. Extent; reach; scope; importance; as, a project of large
dimensions.

3. (Math.)

Defn: The degree of manifoldness of a quantity; as, time is quantity
having one dimension; volume has three dimensions, relative to
extension.

4. (Alg.)

Defn: A literal factor, as numbered in characterizing a term. The
term dimensions forms with the cardinal numbers a phrase equivalent
to degree with the ordinal; thus, a2b2c is a term of five dimensions,
or of the fifth degree.

5. pl. (Phys.)

Defn: The manifoldness with which the fundamental units of time,
length, and mass are involved in determining the units of other
physical quantities. Thus, since the unit of velocity varies directly
as the unit of length and inversely as the unit of time, the
dimensions of velocity are said to be length ÷ time; the dimensions
of work are mass × (length)2 ÷ (time)2; the dimensions of density are
mass ÷ (length)3. Dimension lumber, Dimension scantling, or Dimension
stock (Carp.), lumber for building, etc., cut to the sizes usually in
demand, or to special sizes as ordered.
 -- Dimension stone, stone delivered from the quarry rough, but
brought to such sizes as are requisite for cutting to dimensions
given.
