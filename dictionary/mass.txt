MASS
Mass, n. Etym: [OE. masse, messe, AS. m√¶sse. LL. missa, from L.
mittere, missum, to send, dismiss: cf. F. messe. In the ancient
churches, the public services at which the catechumens were permitted
to be present were called missa catechumenorum, ending with the
reading of the Gospel. Then they were dismissed with these words :
"Ite, missa est" [sc. ecclesia], the congregation is dismissed. After
that the sacrifice proper began. At its close the same words were
said to those who remained. So the word gave the name of Mass to the
sacrifice in the Catholic Church. See Missile, and cf. Christmas,
Lammas, Mess a dish, Missal.]

Mass, n. Etym: [OE. masse, F. masse, L. massa; akin to Gr. Macerate.]

1. A quantity of matter cohering together so as to make one body, or
an aggregation of particles or things which collectively make one
body or quantity, usually of considerable size; as, a mass of ore,
metal, sand, or water.
If it were not for these principles, the bodies of the earth,
planets, comets, sun, and all things in them, would grow cold and
freeze, and become inactive masses. Sir I. Newton.
A deep mass of continual sea is slower stirred To rage. Savile.

2. (Phar.)

Defn: A medicinal substance made into a cohesive, homogeneous lump,
of consistency suitable for making pills; as, blue mass.

3. A large quantity; a sum.
All the mass of gold that comes into Spain. Sir W. Raleigh.
He had spent a huge mass of treasure. Sir J. Davies.

4. Bulk; magnitude; body; size.
This army of such mass and charge. Shak.

5. The principal part; the main body.
Night closed upon the pursuit, and aided the mass of the fugitives in
their escape. Jowett (Thucyd.).

6. (Physics)

Defn: The quantity of matter which a body contains, irrespective of
its bulk or volume.

Note: Mass and weight are often used, in a general way, as
interchangeable terms, since the weight of a body is proportional to
its mass (under the same or equal gravitative forces), and the mass
is usually ascertained from the weight. Yet the two ideas, mass and
weight, are quite distinct. Mass is the quantity of matter in a body;
weight is the comparative force with which it tends towards the
center of the earth. A mass of sugar and a mass of lead are assumed
to be equal when they show an equal weight by balancing each other in
the scales. Blue mass. See under Blue.
 -- Mass center (Geom.), the center of gravity of a triangle.
 -- Mass copper, native copper in a large mass.
 -- Mass meeting, a large or general assembly of people, usually a
