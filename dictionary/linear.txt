equation which is of the first degree, when the expression which is
equated to zero is regarded as a function of the dependent variable
and its differential coefficients.
 -- Linear equation (Math.), an equation of the first degree between
two variables; -- so called because every such equation may be
considered as representing a right line.
 -- Linear measure, the measurement of length.
 -- Linear numbers (Math.), such numbers as have relation to length
only: such is a number which represents one side of a plane figure.
If the plane figure is square, the linear figure is called a root.
 -- Linear problem (Geom.), a problem which may be solved
geometrically by the use of right lines alone.
 -- Linear transformation (Alg.), a change of variables where each
