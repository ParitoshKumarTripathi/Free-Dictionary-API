At"om, n. Etym: [L. atomus, Gr. atome. See Tome.]

1. (Physics)
(a) An ultimate indivisible particle of matter.
(b) An ultimate particle of matter not necessarily indivisible; a
molecule.
(c) A constituent particle of matter, or a molecule supposed to be
made up of subordinate particles.

Note: These three definitions correspond to different views of the
nature of the ultimate particles of matter. In the case of the last
two, the particles are more correctly called molecules. Dana.

2. (Chem.)

Defn: The smallest particle of matter that can enter into
combination; one of the elementary constituents of a molecule.
