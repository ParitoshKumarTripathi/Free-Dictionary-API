TWIN
Twin, a. Etym: [OE. twin double, AS. getwinne two and two, pl.,
twins; akin to D. tweeling a twin, G. zwilling, OHG. zwiniling, Icel.
tvennr, tvinnr, two and two, twin, and to AS. twi- two. See Twice,
Two.]

1. Being one of two born at a birth; as, a twin brother or sister.

2. Being one of a pair much resembling one another; standing the
relation of a twin to something else; -- often followed by to or
with. Shak.

3. (Bot.)

Defn: Double; consisting of two similar and corresponding parts.

4. (Crystallog.)

Defn: Composed of parts united according to some definite law of
twinning. See Twin, n., 4. Twin boat, or Twin ship (Naut.), a vessel
whose deck and upper works rest on two parallel hulls.
 -- Twin crystal. See Twin, n., 4.
 -- Twin flower (Bot.), a delicate evergreen plant (Linnæa borealis)

TWIN

=====
Twin, n.

1. One of two produced at a birth, especially by an animal that
ordinarily brings forth but one at a birth; -- used chiefly in the
plural, and applied to the young of beasts as well as to human young.

2. pl. (Astron.)

Defn: A sign and constellation of the zodiac; Gemini. See Gemini.

3. A person or thing that closely resembles another.

4. (Crystallog.)

Defn: A compound crystal composed of two or more crystals, or parts
of crystals, in reversed position with reference to each other.

Note: The relative position of the parts of a twin may be explained
by supposing one part to be revolved 180º about a certain axis
(called the twinning axis), this axis being normal to a plane (called
the twinning plane) which is usually one of the fundamental planes of
the crystal. This revolution brings the two parts into parallel
position, or vice versa. A contact twin is one in which the parts are
united by a plane surface, called the composition face, which is
usually the same as the twinning plane. A penetration twin is one in
which the parts interpenetrate each other, often very irregularly.
Twins are also called, according to form, cruciform, geniculated,
etc.
