PEMBROKE TABLE
Pem"broke ta`ble. [From Pembroke, a town and shire in Wales.]

Defn: A style of four-legged table in vogue in England, chiefly in
the later Georgian period.

The characteristic which gives a table the name of Pembroke consists
in the drop leaves, which are held up, when the table is open, by
brackets which turn under the top.
