WALL-EYED
Wall"-eyed`, a. Etym: [Icel. valdeygedhr, or vagleygr; fr. vagl a
beam, a beam in the eye (akin to Sw. vagel a roost, a perch, a sty in
the eye) + eygr having eyes (from auga eye). See Eye.]

Defn: Having an eye of a very light gray or whitish color. Booth.

Note: Shakespeare, in using wall-eyed as a term of reproach (as
"wall-eyed rage," a "wall-eyed wretch"), alludes probably to the idea
of unnatural or distorted vision. See the Note under Wall-eye. It is
an eye which is utterly and incurably perverted, an eye that knows no
pity.
