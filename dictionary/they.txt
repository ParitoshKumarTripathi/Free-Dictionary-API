THEY
They, pron. pl.; poss. Theirs; obj. Them. Etym: [Icel. þeir they,
properly nom. pl. masc. of sa, su, þat, a demonstrative pronoun, akin
to the English definite article, AS. se, seó, edhæt, nom. pl. edha.

Defn: The plural of he, she, or it. They is never used adjectively,
but always as a pronoun proper, and sometimes refers to persons
without an antecedent expressed.

the French use on; as, they say (French on dit), that is, it is said
by persons not specified.
