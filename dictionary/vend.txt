VEND
Vend, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Vended; p. pr. & vb. n. Vending.] Etym: [F.
vendre, L. vendere, from venum dare; venus sale + dare to give. See
2d Venal, Date, time.]

Defn: To transfer to another person for a pecuniary equivalent; to
make an object of trade; to dispose of by sale; to sell; as, to vend
goods; to vend vegetables.

Note: Vend differs from barter. We vend for money; we barter for
commodities. Vend is used chiefly of wares, merchandise, or other
small articles, not of lands and tenements.
