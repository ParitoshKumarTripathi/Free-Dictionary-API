QUINTAIN
Quin"tain, n. Etym: [F. quintaine, LL. quintana; cf. W. chwintan a
kind of hymeneal game.]

Defn: An object to be tilted at; -- called also quintel. [Written
also quintin.]

Note: A common form in the Middle Ages was an upright post, on the
top of which turned a crosspiece, having on one end a broad board,
and on the other a sand bag. The endeavor was to strike the board
with the lance while riding under, and get away without being hit by
the sand bag. "But a quintain, a mere lifeless block." Shak.
