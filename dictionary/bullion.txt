denote gold and silver, both coined and uncoined, when reckoned by
weight and in mass, including especially foreign, or uncurrent, coin.

And those which eld's strict doom did disallow, And damm for bullion,
go for current now. Sylvester.

3. Showy metallic ornament, as of gold, silver, or copper, on
bridles, saddles, etc. [Obs.]
The clasps and bullions were worth a thousand pound. Skelton.

prominent.
