Au"gust, n. Etym: [L. Augustus. See note below, and August, a.]

Defn: The eighth month of the year, containing thirty-one days.

Note: The old Roman name was Sextilis, the sixth month from March,
the month in which the primitive Romans, as well as Jews, began the
year. The name was changed to August in honor of Augustus CÃ¦sar, the
first emperor of Rome, on account of his victories, and his entering
on his first consulate in that month.
