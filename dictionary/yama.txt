YAMA
Ya"ma, n. Etym: [Skr. yama a twin.] (Hindoo Myth.)

Defn: The king of the infernal regions, corresponding to the Greek
Pluto, and also the judge of departed souls. In later times he is
more exclusively considered the dire judge of all, and the tormentor
of the wicked. He is represented as of a green color, with red
garments, having a crown on his head, his eyes inflamed, and sitting
on a buffalo, with a club and noose in his hands.
