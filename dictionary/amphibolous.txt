AMPHIBOLOUS
Am*phib"o*lous, a. Etym: [L. amphibolus, Gr. Amphibole.]

1. Ambiguous; doubtful. [Obs.]
Never was there such an amphibolous quarrel -- both parties declaring
themselves for the king. Howell.

2. (Logic)

Defn: Capable of two meanings.
An amphibolous sentence is one that is capable of two meanings, not
from the double sense of any of the words, but from its admitting of
a double construction; e. g., "The duke yet lives that Henry shall
depose." Whately.
