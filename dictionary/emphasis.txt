EMPHASIS
Em"pha*sis, n.; pl. Emphases. Etym: [L., fr. Gr. In, and Phase.]

1. (Rhet.)

Defn: A particular stress of utterance, or force of voice, given in
reading and speaking to one or more words whose signification the
speaker intends to impress specially upon his audience.
The province of emphasis is so much more important than accent, that
the customary seat of the latter is changed, when the claims of
emphasis require it. E. Porter.

2. A peculiar impressiveness of expression or weight of thought;
vivid representation, enforcing assent; as, to dwell on a subject
with great emphasis.
External objects stand before us . . . in all the life and emphasis
of extension, figure, and color. Sir W. Hamilton.
