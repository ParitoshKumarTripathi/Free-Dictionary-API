Man"age, n. Etym: [F. manège, It. maneggio, fr. maneggiare to manage,
fr. L.manushand. Perhaps somewhat influenced by F. ménage

Manege.]

Defn: The handling or government of anything, but esp. of a horse;
management; administration. See Manege. [Obs.]
Young men, in the conduct and manage of actions, embrace more than
