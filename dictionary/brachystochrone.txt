BRACHYSTOCHRONE
Bra*chys"to*chrone, n. Etym: [Incorrect for brachistochrone, fr. Gr.
brachistochrone. ] (Math.)

Defn: A curve, in which a body, starting from a given point, and
descending solely by the force of gravity, will reach another given
point in a shorter time than it could by any other path. This curve
of quickest descent, as it is sometimes called, is, in a vacuum, the
same as the cycloid.
