LEARN
Learn, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Learned, or Learnt (p. pr. & vb. n.
Learning.] Etym: [OE. lernen, leornen, AS. leornian; akin to OS.
linon, for lirnon, OHG. lirnen, lernen, G. lernen, fr. the root of
AS. l to teach, OS. lerian, OHG.leran, G. lehren, Goth. laisjan, also
Goth lais I know, leis acquainted (in comp.); all prob. from a root
meaning, to go, go over, and hence, to learn; cf. AS. leoran to go .
Cf. Last a mold of the foot, lore.]

1. To gain knowledge or information of; to ascertain by inquiry,
study, or investigation; to receive instruction concerning; to fix in
the mind; to acquire understanding of, or skill; as, to learn the
way; to learn a lesson; to learn dancing; to learn to skate; to learn
the violin; to learn the truth about something. "Learn to do well."
Is. i. 17.
Now learn a parable of the fig tree. Matt. xxiv. 32.

2. To communicate knowledge to; to teach. [Obs.]
Hast thou not learned me how To make perfumes Shak.

Note: Learn formerly had also the sense of teach, in accordance with
the analogy of the French and other languages, and hence we find it
with this sense in Shakespeare, Spenser, and other old writers. This
usage has now passed away. To learn is to receive instruction, and to
teach is to give instruction. He who is taught learns, not he who
teaches.
