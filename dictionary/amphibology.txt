AMPHIBOLOGY
Am`phi*bol"o*gy, n.; pl. Amphibologies. Etym: [L. amphibologia, for
amphibolia, fr. Gr. logia as if fr. Gr. amphibologie. See Amphiboly.]

Defn: A phrase, discourse, or proposition, susceptible of two
interpretations; and hence, of uncertain meaning. It differs from
equivocation, which arises from the twofold sense of a single term.
