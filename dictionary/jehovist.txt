JEHOVIST
Je*ho"vist, n.

1. One who maintains that the vowel points of the word Jehovah, in
Hebrew, are the proper vowels of that word; -- opposed to adonist.

2. The writer of the passages of the Old Testament, especially those
of the Pentateuch, in which the Supreme Being is styled Jehovah. See
Elohist.
The characteristic manner of the Jehovist differs from that of his
predecessor [the Elohist]. He is fuller and freer in his
descriptions; more reflective in his assignment of motives and
causes; more artificial in mode of narration. S. Davidson.
