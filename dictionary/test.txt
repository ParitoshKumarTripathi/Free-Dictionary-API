Syn.
 -- Criterion; standard; experience; proof; experiment; trial.
 -- Test, Trial. Trial is the wider term; test is a searching and
decisive trial. It is derived from the Latin testa (earthen pot),
which term was early applied to the fining pot, or crucible, in which
metals are melted for trial and refinement. Hence the peculiar force
of the word, as indicating a trial or criterion of the most decisive
kind.
I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better
publish his commediation. Shak.
Thy virtue, prince, has stood the test of fortune, Like purest gold,
that tortured in the furnace, Comes out more bright, and brings forth
all its weight. Addison.
