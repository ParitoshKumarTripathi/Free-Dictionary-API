fr. shi'at, shi'ah, a multitude following one another in pursuit of
the same object, the sect of Ali, fr. sha'a to follow.]

Defn: A member of that branch of the Mohammedans to which the
Persians belong. They reject the first three caliphs, and consider
Ali as being the first and only rightful successor of Mohammed. They
do not acknowledge the Sunna, or body of traditions respecting
Mohammed, as any part of the law, and on these accounts are treated
as heretics by the Sunnites, or orthodox Mohammedans.
