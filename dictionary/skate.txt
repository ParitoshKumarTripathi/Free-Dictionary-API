Skate, n. Etym: [Icel. skata; cf. Prov. G. schatten, meer-schatten,
L. squatus, squatina, and E. shad.] (Zoöl.)

Defn: Any one of numerous species of large, flat elasmobranch fishes
of the genus Raia, having a long, slender tail, terminated by a small
caudal fin. The pectoral fins, which are large and broad and united
to the sides of the body and head, give a somewhat rhombic form to
these fishes. The skin is more or less spinose.

Note: Some of the species are used for food, as the European blue or
gray skate (Raia batis), which sometimes weighs nearly 200 pounds.
The American smooth, or barn-door, skate (R. lævis) is also a large
species, often becoming three or four feet across. The common spiny
skate (R. erinacea) is much smaller. Skate's egg. See Sea purse.
 -- Skate sucker, any marine leech of the genus Pontobdella,
parasitic on skates.
