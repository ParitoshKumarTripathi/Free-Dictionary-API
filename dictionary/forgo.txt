FORGO
For*go", v. t. [imp. Forwent; p. p. Forgone; p. pr. & vb. n.
Forgoing.] Etym: [OE. forgan, forgon, forgoon, AS. forgan, prop., to
go past, hence, to abstain from; pref. for- + gan to go; akin to G.
vergehen to pass away, to transgress. See Go, v. i.]

Defn: To pass by; to leave. See 1st Forego.
For sith [since] I shall forgoon my liberty At your request. Chaucer.

correct.
