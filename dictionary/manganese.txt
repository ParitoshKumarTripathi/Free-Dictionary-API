manganite, etc. Symbol Mn. Atomic weight 54.8.

Note: An alloy of manganese with iron (called ferromanganese) is used
to increase the density and hardness of steel. Black oxide of
manganese, Manganese dioxide or peroxide, or Black manganese (Chem.),
a heavy black powder MnO2, occurring native as the mineral
