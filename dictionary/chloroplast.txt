CHLOROPLAST
Chlo"ro*plast, n. [Pref. chloro-+ Gr.  to mold, form.] (Biol.)

Defn: A plastid containing chlorophyll, developed only in cells
exposed to the light. Chloroplasts are minute flattened granules,
usually occurring in great numbers in the cytoplasm near the cell
wall, and consist of a colorless ground substance saturated with
chlorophyll pigments. Under light of varying intensity they exhibit
phototactic movements. In animals chloroplasts occur only in certain
low forms.
