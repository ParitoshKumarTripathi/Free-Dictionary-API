GALLIGASKINS
Gal`li*gas"kins, n. pl. Etym: [Prob. corrupted fr. It. Grechesco
Grecian, a name which seems to have been given in Venice, and to have
been afterwards confused with Gascony, as if they came from Gascony.]

Defn: Loose hose or breeches; leather leg quards. The word is used
loosely and often in a jocose sense.
