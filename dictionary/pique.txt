Pique denotes a quick and often transient sense of resentment for
some supposed neglect or injury, but it is not marked by malevolence.
Spite is a stronger term, denoting settled ill will or malice, with a
desire to injure, as the result of extreme irritation. Grudge goes
still further, denoting cherished and secret enmity, with an
unforgiving spirit. A pique is usually of recent date; a grudge is
that which has long subsisted; spite implies a disposition to cross
or vex others.
