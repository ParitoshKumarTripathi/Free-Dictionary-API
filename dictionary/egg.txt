the new organism is ultimately formed. See Segmentation of the ovum,
under Segmentation.
 -- Egg development (Biol.), the process of the development of an
egg, by which the embryo is formed.
 -- Egg mite (Zoöl.), any mite which devours the eggs of insects, as
Nothrus ovivorus, which destroys those of the canker worm.
