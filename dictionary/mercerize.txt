MERCERIZE
Mer"cer*ize, v. t.  [imp. & p. p. -ized; p. pr. & vb. n. -izing.]
[From (John) Mercer (1791-1866), an English calico printer who
introduced the process + -ize.]

Defn: To treat (cotton fiber or fabrics) with a solution of caustic
alkali. Such treatment causes the fiber to shrink in length and
become stronger and more receptive of dyes. If the yarn or cloth is
kept under tension during the process, it assumes a silky luster. --
