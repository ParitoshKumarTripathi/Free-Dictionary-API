De*cry", v. t. [imp. & p. p. Decried; p. pr. & vb. n. Decrying.]
Etym: [F. décrier, OF. descrier; pref. des- (L. dis-) + crier to cry.
See Cry, and cf. Descry.]

Defn: To cry down; to censure as faulty, mean, or worthless; to
clamor against; to blame clamorously; to discredit; to disparage.
For small errors they whole plays decry. Dryden.
Measures which are extolled by one half of the kingdom are naturally
decried by the other. Addison.

Syn.
 -- To Decry, Depreciate, Detract, Disparage. Decry and depreciate
refer to the estimation of a thing, the former seeking to lower its
value by clamorous censure, the latter by representing it as of
little worth. Detract and disparage also refer to merit or value,
which the former assails with caviling, insinuation, etc., while the
latter willfully underrates and seeks to degrade it. Men decry their
rivals and depreciate their measures. The envious detract from the
merit of a good action, and disparage the motives of him who performs
it.
