TALIPES
Tal"i*pes, n. Etym: [NL., fr. L. talus an ankle + pes, pedis, a foot;
cf. L. talipedare to be weak in the feet, properly, to walk on the
ankles.] (Surg.)

Defn: The deformity called clubfoot. See Clubfoot.

Note: Several varieties are distinguished; as, Talipes varus, in
which the foot is drawn up and bent inward; T. valgus, in which the
foot is bent outward; T. equinus, in which the sole faces backward
and the patient walks upon the balls of the toes; and T. calcaneus
(called also talus), in which the sole faces forward and the patient
walks upon the heel.
