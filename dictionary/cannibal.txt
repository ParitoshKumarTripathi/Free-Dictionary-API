CANNIBAL
Can"ni*bal, n. Etym: [Cf. F. cannibale. Columbus, in a letter to the
Spanish monarchs written in Oct., 1498, mentions that the people of
Hayti lived in great fear of the Caribales (equivalent to E.
Caribbees.), the inhabitants of the smaller Antilles; which form of
the name was afterward changed into NL. Canibales, in order to
express more forcibly their character by a word intelligible through
a Latin root "propter rabiem caninam anthropophagorum gentis." The
Caribbees call themselves, in their own language. Calinago, Carinago,
Calliponam, and, abbreviated, Calina, signifying a brave, from which
Columbus formed his Caribales.]

its own kind. Darwin.
