JUJUTSU; JUJITSU; JIUJUTSU; JIUJITSU
Ju"jut`su, n. Also Ju"jit`su, Jiu"jut`su, Jiu"jit`su. [Jap. jujutsu;
ju soft (prob. because no weapons are used) + jutsu art.]

Defn: The Japanese art of self-defense without weapons, now widely
used as a system of physical training. It depends for its efficiency
largely upon the principle of making use of an opponent's strength
and weight to disable or injure him, and by applying pressure so that
his opposing movement will throw him out of balance, dislocate or
break a joint, etc.  It opposes knowledge and skill to brute
strength, and demands an extensive practical knowledge of human
anatomy.
