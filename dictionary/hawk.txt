HAWK

akin to D. havik, OHG. habuh, G. habicht, Icel. haukr, Sw. hök, Dan.
hög, prob. from the root of E. heave.] (Zoöl.)

Defn: One of numerous species and genera of rapacious birds of the
family Falconidæ. They differ from the true falcons in lacking the
prominent tooth and notch of the bill, and in having shorter and less
pointed wings. Many are of large size and grade into the eagles.
Some, as the goshawk, were formerly trained like falcons. In a more
general sense the word is not infrequently applied, also, to true
falcons, as the sparrow hawk, pigeon hawk, duck hawk, and prairie
hawk.

Note: Among the common American species are the red-tailed hawk
(Buteo borealis); the red-shouldered (B. lineatus); the broad-winged
(B. Pennsylvanicus); the rough-legged (Archibuteo lagopus); the
sharp-shinned Accipiter fuscus). See Fishhawk, Goshawk, Marsh hawk,
under Marsh, Night hawk, under Night. Bee hawk (Zoöl.), the honey
buzzard.
 -- Eagle hawk. See under Eagle.
 -- Hawk eagle (Zoöl.), an Asiatic bird of the genus Spizætus, or
Limnætus, intermediate between the hawks and eagles. There are
several species.
 -- Hawk fly (Zoöl.), a voracious fly of the family Asilidæ. See
Hornet fly, under Hornet.
 -- Hawk moth. (Zoöl.) See Hawk moth, in the Vocabulary.
 -- Hawk owl. (Zoöl.) (a) A northern owl (Surnia ulula) of Europe and
America. It flies by day, and in some respects resembles the hawks.
(b) An owl of India (Ninox scutellatus).
