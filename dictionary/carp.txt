Carp, n.; pl. Carp, formerly Carps. Etym: [Cf. Icel. karfi, Dan.
karpe, Sw. karp, OHG. charpho, G. karpfen, F. carpe, LL. carpa.]
(Zoöl.)

Defn: A fresh-water herbivorous fish (Cyprinus carpio.). Several
other species of Cyprinus, Catla, and Carassius are called carp. See
Cruclan carp.

Note: The carp was originally from Asia, whence it was early
introduced into Europe, where it is extensively reared in artificial
ponds. Within a few years it has been introduced into America, and
widely distributed by the government. Domestication has produced
several varieties, as the leather carp, which is nearly or quite
destitute of scales, and the mirror carp, which has only a few large
scales. Intermediate varieties occur. Carp louse (Zoöl.), a small
crustacean, of the genus Argulus, parasitic on carp and allied
fishes. See Branchiura.
 -- Carp mullet (Zoöl.), a fish (Moxostoma carpio) of the Ohio River
and Great Lakes, allied to the suckers.
 -- Carp sucker (Zoöl.), a name given to several species of fresh-
water fishes of the genus Carpiodes in the United States; -- called
also quillback.
