AUTOSTABILITY
Au`to*sta*bil"i*ty, n.  [Auto-+ stability.] (Mechanics)

Defn: Automatic stability; also, inherent stability. An aëroplane is
inherently stable if it keeps in steady poise by virtue of its shape
and proportions alone; it is automatically stable if it keeps in
steady poise by means of self-operative mechanism.
