RICKETS
Rick"ets, n. pl. Etym: [Of uncertain origin; but cf. AS. wrigian to
bend, D. wrikken to shake, E. wriggle.] (Med.)

Defn: A disease which affects children, and which is characterized by
a bulky head, crooked spine and limbs, depressed ribs, enlarged and
spongy articular epiphyses, tumid abdomen, and short stature,
together with clear and often premature mental faculties. The
essential cause of the disease appears to be the nondeposition of
earthy salts in the osteoid tissues. Children afflicted with this
malady stand and walk unsteadily. Called also rachitis.
