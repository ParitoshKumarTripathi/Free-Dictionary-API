EQUIVALENT
E*quiv"a*lent, a. Etym: [L. aequivalens, -entis, p. pr. of
aequivalere to have equal power; aequus equal + valere to be strong,
be worth: cf. F. équivalent. See Equal, and Valiant.]

1. Equal in wortir or value, force, power, effect, import, and the
like; alike in significance and value; of the same import or meaning.
For now to serve and to minister, servile and ministerial, are terms
equivalent. South.

2. (Geom.)

Defn: Equal in measure but not admitting of superposition; -- applied
to magnitudes; as, a square may be equivalent to a triangle.

3. (Geol.)

Defn: Contemporaneous in origin; as, the equivalent strata of
different countries.
EQUIVALENT

=====
E*quiv"a*lent, n.

1. Something equivalent; that which is equal in value, worth, weight,
or force; as, to offer an equivalent for damage done.
He owned that, if the Test Act were repealed, the Protestants were
entitled to some equivalent. . . . During some weeks the word
equivalent, then lately imported from France, was in the mouths of
all the coffeehouse. Macaulay.

2. (Chem.)

Defn: That comparative quantity by weight of an element which
possesses the same chemical value as other elements, as determined by
actual experiment and reference to the same standard. Specifically:
(a) The comparative proportions by which one element replaces another
in any particular compound; thus, as zinc replaces hydrogen in
hydrochloric acid, their equivalents are 32.5 and 1. (b) The
combining proportion by weight of a substance, or the number
expressing this proportion, in any particular compound; as, the
equivalents of hydrogen and oxygen in water are respectively 1 and 8,
and in hydric dioxide 1 and 16.

Note: This term was adopted by Wollaston to avoid using the
conjectural expression atomic weight, with which, however, for a time
it was practically synonymous. The attempt to limit the term to the
meaning of a universally comparative combining weight failed, because
of the possibility of several compounds of the substances by reason
of the variation in combining power which most elements exhibit. The
equivalent was really identical with, or a multiple of submultiple
of, the atomic weight.

3. (Chem.)

Defn: A combining unit, whether an atom, a radical, or a molecule;
as, in acid salt two or more equivalents of acid unite with one or
more equivalents of base. Mechanical equivalent of heat (Physics),
the number of units of work which the unit of heat can perform; the
mechanical energy which must be expended to raise the temperature of
a unit weight of water from 0º C. to 1º C., or from 32º F. to 33º F.
The term was introduced by Dr. Mayer of Heilbronn. Its value was
found by Joule to be 1390 foot pounds upon the Centigrade, or 772
foot pounds upon the Fahrenheit, thermometric scale, whence it is
often called Joule's equivalent, and represented by the symbol J.
This is equal to 424 kilogram meters (Centigrade scale). A more
recent determination by Professor Rowland gives the value 426.9
kilogram meters, for the latitude of Baltimore.
