Defn: One of the names under which Vishnu, in his incarnation as
Krishna, is worshiped by the Hindoos. [Written also Juggernnath,
Jaganath, Jaganatha, etc.]

Note: The principal seat of the worship of Juggernaut is at PÃ»ri in

multitude, on a high car with sixteen wheels. Formerly, fanatics
sometimes threw themselves under the wheels to be crushed as a
sacrifice to the god.
