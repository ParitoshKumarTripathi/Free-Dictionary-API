sorrowful, or unhappy; -- said of persons, and often followed by of,
at, that, or by the infinitive, and sometimes by with, introducing
the cause or reason.

 -- Glad, Delighted, Gratified. Delighted expresses a much higher
degree of pleasure than glad. Gratified always refers to a pleasure
conferred by some human agent, and the feeling is modified by the
consideration that we owe it in part to another. A person may be glad
or delighted to see a friend, and gratified at the attention shown by
his visits.
