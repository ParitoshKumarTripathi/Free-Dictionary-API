=====
The (the, when emphatic or alone; the, obscure before a vowel; the,
obscure before a consonant; 37), definite article. Etym: [AS. the, a
later form for earlier nom. sing. masc. se, formed under the
influence of the oblique cases. See That, pron.]

Defn: A word placed before nouns to limit or individualize their
meaning.

Note: The was originally a demonstrative pronoun, being a weakened
form of that. When placed before adjectives and participles, it
converts them into abstract nouns; as, the sublime and the beautiful.
Burke. The is used regularly before many proper names, as of rivers,
oceans, ships, etc.; as, the Nile, the Atlantic, the Great Eastern,
the West Indies, The Hague. The with an epithet or ordinal number
often follows a proper name; as, Alexander the Great; Napoleon the
Third. The may be employed to individualize a particular kind or
species; as, the grasshopper shall be a burden. Eccl. xii. 5.

difficult it is to reform. "Yet not the more cease I." Milton.
So much the rather thou, Celestial Light, Shine inward, and the mind
through all her powers Irradiate. Milton.
