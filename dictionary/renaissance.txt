RENAISSANCE
Re*nais`sance" (F. re-n`sns"; E. r-ns"sans), n. Etym: [F., fr.
renaître to be born again. Cf. Renascence.]

Defn: A new birth, or revival. Specifically:
(a) The transitional movement in Europe, marked by the revival of
classical learning and art in Italy in the 15th century, and the
similar revival following in other countries.
(b) The style of art which prevailed at this epoch.
The Renaissance was rather the last stage of the Middle Ages,
emerging from ecclesiastical and feudal despotism, developing what
was original in mediæval ideas by the light of classic arts and
letters. J. A. Symonds (Encyc. Brit. ).
