Ye (ye), pron. Etym: [OE. ye, ýe, nom. pl., AS. ge, gi; cf. OS. ge,
gi, OFries. gi, i, D. gij, Dan. & Sw. i, Icel. er, OHG. ir, G. ihr,
Goth. jus, Lith. jus, Gr. yuyam.

Defn: The plural of the pronoun of the second person in the
nominative case.
Ye ben to me right welcome heartily. Chaucer.
But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified. 1 Cor. vi. 11.
This would cost you your life in case ye were a man. Udall.

Note: In Old English ye was used only as a nominative, and you only
as a dative or objective. In the 16th century, however, ye and you
became confused and were often used interchangeably, both as
nominatives and objectives, and you has now superseded ye except in
solemn or poetic use. See You, and also the first Note under Thou.
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye. Shak.
I come, kind gentlemen, strange news to tell ye. Dryden.
