explaining compound; as, battle brand, a "brand" or sword used in
battle; battle cry; battlefield; battle ground; battlearray; battle
song. Battle piece, a painting, or a musical composition,
representing a battle.
 -- Battle royal. (a) A fight between several gamecocks, where the
one that stands longest is the victor. Grose. (b) A contest with
fists or cudgels in which more than two are engaged; a mêlée.

Syn.
 -- Conflict; encounter; contest; action. Battle, Combat, Fight,
Engagement. These words agree in denoting a close encounter between
contending parties. Fight is a word of less dignity than the others.
Except in poetry, it is more naturally applied to the encounter of a
few individuals, and more commonly an accidental one; as, a street
fight. A combat is a close encounter, whether between few or many,
and is usually premeditated. A battle is commonly more general and
prolonged. An engagement supposes large numbers on each side, engaged
or intermingled in the conflict.
