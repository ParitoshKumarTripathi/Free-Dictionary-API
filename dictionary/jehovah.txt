JEHOVAH

âdonai Lord), sometimes (to avoid repetition) yêhovih (with the vowel
points of êlohim God); but only the four Heb, consonants yhvh are
conceded to be certainly known.]

to the Jews as their covenant God or Sovereign of the theocracy; the
"ineffable name" of the Supreme Being, which was not pronounced by
the Jews.
