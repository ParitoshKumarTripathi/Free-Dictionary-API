REMARK
Re*mark" (r-mrk"), v. t. [imp. & p. p. Remarked (-mrkt"); p. pr. &
vb. n. Remarking.] Etym: [F. remarquer; pref. re- re- + marquer to
mark, marque a mark, of German origin, akin to E. mark. See Mark, v.&
n.]

1. To mark in a notable manner; to distinquish clearly; to make
noticeable or conspicuous; to piont out. [Obs.]
Thou art a man remarked to taste a mischief. Ford.
His manacles remark him; there he sits. Milton.

2. To take notice of, or to observe, mentally; as, to remark the
manner of a speaker.

3. To express in words or writing, as observed or noticed; to state;
to say; -- often with a substantive clause; as, he remarked that it
was time to go.

Syn.
 -- To observe; notice; heed; regard; note; say.
 -- Remark, Observe, Notice. To observe is to keep or hold a thing
distinctly before the mind. To remark is simply to mark or take note
of whatever may come up. To notice implies still less continuity of
attention. When we turn from these mental states to the expression of
them in language, we find the same distinction. An observation is
properly the result of somewhat prolonged thought; a remark is
usually suggested by some passing occurence; a notice is in most
cases something cursory and short. This distinction is not always
maintained as to remark and observe, which are often used
interchangeably. "Observing men may form many judgments by the rules
of similitude and proportion." I. Watts. "He can not distinguish
difficult and noble speculations from trifling and vulgar remarks."
Collier. "The thing to be regarded, in taking notice of a child's
miscarriage, is what root it springs from." Locke.
