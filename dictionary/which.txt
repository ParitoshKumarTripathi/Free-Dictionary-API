WHICH
Which, pron. Etym: [OE. which, whilk, AS. hwilc, hwylc, hwelc, from
the root of hwa who + lic body; hence properly, of what sort or kind;
akin to OS. hwilik which, OFries. hwelik, D. welk, G. welch, OHG.
welih, hwelih, Icel. hvilikr, Dan. & Sw. hvilken, Goth. hwileiks,
hwleiks; cf. L. qualis. Who, and Like, a., and cf. Such.]

1. Of what sort or kind; what; what a; who. [Obs.]
And which they weren and of what degree. Chaucer.

2. A interrogative pronoun, used both substantively and adjectively,
and in direct and indirect questions, to ask for, or refer to, an
individual person or thing among several of a class; as, which man is
it which woman was it which is the house he asked which route he
should take; which is best, to live or to die See the Note under
What, pron., 1.
Which of you convinceth me of sin John viii. 46.

3. A relative pronoun, used esp. in referring to an antecedent noun
or clause, but sometimes with reference to what is specified or
implied in a sentence, or to a following noun or clause (generally
involving a reference, however, to something which has preceded). It
is used in all numbers and genders, and was formerly used of persons.
And when thou fail'st -- as God forbid the hour! --Must Edward fall,
which peril heaven forfend! Shak.
God . . . rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had
made. Gen. ii. 2.
Our Father, which art in heaven. Matt. vi. 9.
The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. 1 Cor. iii. 17.

4. A compound relative or indefinite pronoun, standing for any one
which, whichever, that which, those which, the . . . which, and the
like; as, take which you will.

Note: The which was formerly often used for which. The expressions
which that, which as, were also sometimes used by way of emphasis.
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called
James ii. 7.

Note: Which, referring to a series of preceding sentences, or members
of a sentence, may have all joined to it adjectively. "All which, as
a method of a proclamation, is very convenient." Carlyle.
