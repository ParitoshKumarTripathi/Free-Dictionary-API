muscles; -- opposed to extrinsic. Intrinsic energy of a body
(Physics), the work it can do in virtue of its actual condition,
without any supply of energy from without.
 -- Intrinsic equation of a curve (Geom.), the equation which
expresses the relation which the length of a curve, measured from a
given point of it, to a movable point, has to the angle which the
tangent to the curve at the movable point makes with a fixed line.
 -- Intrinsic value. See the Note under Value, n.

Syn.
 -- Inherent; innate; natural; real; genuine.
