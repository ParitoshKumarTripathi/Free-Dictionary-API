MYXOMYCETES
Myx`o*my*ce"tes, n. pl. [NL.; Gr.  mucus, slime + myceles.] (Bot.)

Defn: A class of peculiar organisms, the slime molds, formerly
regarded as animals (Mycetozoa), but now generally thought to be
plants and often separated as a distinct phylum (Myxophyta). They are
found on damp earth and decaying vegetable matter, and consist of
naked masses of protoplasm, often of considerable size, which creep
very slowly  over the surface and ingest solid food. --
