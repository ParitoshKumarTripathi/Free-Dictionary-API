METAZOA
Met`a*zo"a, n. pl. Etym: [NL., fr. Gr. (Zo√∂l.)

Defn: Those animals in which the protoplasmic mass, constituting the
egg, is converted into a multitude of cells, which are metamorphosed
into the tissues of the body. A central cavity is commonly developed,
and the cells around it are at first arranged in two layers, -- the
ectoderm and endoderm. The group comprises nearly all animals except
the Protozoa.
