 -- Journey, Tour, Excursion, Pilgrimage. The word journey suggests
the idea of a somewhat prolonged traveling for a specific object,
leading a person to pass directly from one point to another. In a
tour, we take a roundabout course from place to place, more commonly
for pleasure, though sometimes on business. An excursion is usually a
brief tour or trip for pleasure, health, etc. In a pilgrimage we
travel to a place hallowed by our religions affections, or by some
train of sacred or tender associations. A journey on important
business; the tour of Europe; an excursion to the lakes; a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land.
