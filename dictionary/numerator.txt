NUMERATOR
Nu"mer*a"tor, n. Etym: [L. numerator: cf. F. numérateur.]

1. One who numbers.

2. (Math.)

Defn: The term in a fraction which indicates the number of fractional
units that are taken.

Note: In a vulgar fraction the numerator is written above a line;
thus, in the fraction 5/9 (five ninths) 5 is the numerator; in a
decimal fraction it is the number which follows the decimal point.
