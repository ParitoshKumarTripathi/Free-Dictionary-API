SCISSORS
Scis"sors, n. pl. Etym: [OE. sisoures, OF. cisoires (cf. F. ciseaux),
probably fr. LL. cisorium a cutting instrument, fr. L. caedere to
cut. Cf. Chisel, Concise. The modern spelling is due to a mistaken
derivation from L. scissor one who cleaves or divides, fr. scindere,
scissum, to cut, spilt.]

Defn: A cutting instrument resembling shears, but smaller, consisting
of two cutting blades with handles, movable on a pin in the center,
by which they are held together. Often called a pair of scissors.
[Formerly written also cisors, cizars, and scissars.] Scissors
grinder (Zoöl.), the European goatsucker. [Prov. Eng.]
