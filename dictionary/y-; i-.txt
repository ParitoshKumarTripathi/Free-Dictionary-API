Y-, or I-. Etym: [OE. y-, i-, AS. ge-, akin to D. & G. ge-, OHG. gi-,
ga-, Goth. ga-, and perhaps to Latin con-; originally meaning,
together. Cf. Com-, Aware, Enough, Handiwork, Ywis.]

Defn: A prefix of obscure meaning, originally used with verbs,
adverbs, adjectives, nouns, and pronouns. In the Middle English
period, it was little employed except with verbs, being chiefly used
with past participles, though occasionally with the infinitive
Ycleped, or yclept, is perhaps the only word not entirely obsolete
which shows this use.
That no wight mighte it see neither yheere. Chaucer.
Neither to ben yburied nor ybrent. Chaucer.

Note: Some examples of Chaucer's use of this prefix are; ibe, ibeen,
icaught, ycome, ydo, idoon, ygo, iproved, ywrought. It inough,
enough, it is combined with an adjective. Other examples are in the
Vocabulary. Spenser and later writers frequently employed this prefix
when affecting an archaic style, and sometimes used it incorrectly.
