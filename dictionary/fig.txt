FIG
Fig, n. Etym: [F. figue the fruit of the tree, Pr. figa, fr. L. ficus
fig tree, fig. Cf. Fico.]

1. (Bot.)

Defn: A small fruit tree (Ficus Carica) with large leaves, known from
the remotest antiquity. It was probably native from Syria westward to
the Canary Islands.

2. The fruit of a fig tree, which is of round or oblong shape, and of
various colors.

Note: The fruit of a fig tree is really the hollow end of a stem, and
bears numerous achenia inside the cavity. Many species have little,
hard, inedible figs, and in only a few does the fruit become soft and
pulpy. The fruit of the cultivated varieties is much prized in its
fresh state, and also when dried or preserved. See Caprification.

3. A small piece of tobacco. [U.S.]

4. The value of a fig, practically nothing; a fico; -- used in scorn
or contempt. "A fig for Peter." Shak. Cochineal fig. See Conchineal
fig.
 -- Fig dust, a preparation of fine oatmeal for feeding caged birds.
 -- Fig faun, one of a class of rural deities or monsters supposed to
live on figs. "Therefore shall dragons dwell there with the fig
fauns." Jer. i. 39. (Douay version).
 -- Fig gnat (Zoöl.), a small fly said to be injurious to figs.
 -- Fig leaf, the leaf tree; hence, in allusion to the first clothing
of Adam and Eve (Genesis iii.7), a covering for a thing that ought to
be concealed; esp., an inadequate covering; a symbol for affected
modesty.
 -- Fig marigold (Bot.), the name of several plants of the genus
Mesembryanthemum, some of which are prized for the brilliancy and
beauty of their flowers.
 -- Fig tree (Bot.), any tree of the genus Ficus, but especially F.
Carica which produces the fig of commerce.
