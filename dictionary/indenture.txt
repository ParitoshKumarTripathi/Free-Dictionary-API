INDENTURE
In*den"ture, n. Etym: [OE. endenture, OF. endenture, LL. indentura a
deed in duplicate, with indented edges. See the Note below. See
Indent.]

1. The act of indenting, or state of being indented.

2. (Law)

Defn: A mutual agreement in writing between two or more parties,
whereof each party has usually a counterpart or duplicate; sometimes
in the pl., a short form for indentures of apprenticeship, the
contract by which a youth is bound apprentice to a master.
The law is the best expositor of the gospel; they are like a pair of
indentures: they answer in every part. C. Leslie.

Note: Indentures were originally duplicates, laid together and
intended by a notched cut or line, or else written on the same piece
of parchment and separated by a notched line so that the two papers
or parchments corresponded to each other. But indenting has gradually
become a mere form, and is often neglected, while the writings or
counterparts retain the name of indentures.
