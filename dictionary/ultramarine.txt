ULTRAMARINE

=====
Ul`tra*ma*rine", n. Etym: [Cf. Sp. ultramarino. So called because the
lapis lazuli was originally brought from beyond the sea, -- from
Asia.] (Chem.)

Defn: A blue pigment formerly obtained by powdering lapis lazuli, but
now produced in large quantities by fusing together silica, alumina,
soda, and sulphur, thus forming a glass, colored blue by the sodium
polysulphides made in the fusion. Also used adjectively. Green
ultramarine, a green pigment obtained as a first product in the
manufacture of ultramarine, into which it is changed by subsequent
treatment.
 -- Ultramarine ash or ashes (Paint.), a pigment which is the
residuum of lapis lazuli after the ultramarine has been extracted. It
was used by the old masters as a middle or neutral tint for flesh,
skies, and draperies, being of a purer and tenderer gray that
produced by the mixture of more positive colors. Fairholt.
