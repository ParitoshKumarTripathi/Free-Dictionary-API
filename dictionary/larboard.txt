LARBOARD
Lar"board`, n. Etym: [Lar- is of uncertain origin, possibly the same
as lower, i. e., humbler in rank, because the starboard side is
considered by mariners as higher in rank; cf. D. laag low, akin to E.
low. See Board, n., 8.] (Naut.)

Defn: The left-hand side of a ship to one on board facing toward the
bow; port; -- opposed to Ant: starboard.

Note: Larboard is a nearly obsolete term, having been superseded by
port to avoid liability of confusion with starboard, owing to
similarity of sound.
