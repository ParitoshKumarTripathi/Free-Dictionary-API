Moor"ish, a. Etym: [See 1st Moor, and cf. Morris, Moresque.]

Defn: Of or pertaining to Morocco or the Moors; in the style of the
Moors. Moorish architecture, the style developed by the Moors in the
later Middle Ages, esp. in Spain, in which the arch had the form of a
horseshoe, and the ornamentation admitted no representation of animal
life. It has many points of resemblance to the Arabian and Persian
styles, but should be distinguished from them. See Illust. under
Moresque.
