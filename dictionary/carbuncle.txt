CARBUNCLE
Car"bun*cle, n. Etym: [L. carbunculus a little coal, a bright kind of
precious stone, a kind of tumor, dim. of carbo coal: cf. F.
carboncle. See Carbon.]

1. (Min.)

Defn: A beautiful gem of a deep red color (with a mixture of scarlet)
called by the Greeks anthrax; found in the East Indies. When held up
to the sun, it loses its deep tinge, and becomes of the color of
burning coal. The name belongs for the most part to ruby sapphire,
though it has been also given to red spinel and garnet.

2. (Med.)

Defn: A very painful acute local inflammation of the subcutaneous
tissue, esp. of the trunk or back of the neck, characterized by
brawny hardness of the affected parts, sloughing of the skin and
deeper tissues, and marked constitutional depression. It differs from
a boil in size, tendency to spread, and the absence of a central
core, and is frequently fatal. It is also called anthrax.

3. (Her.)

Defn: A charge or bearing supposed to represent the precious stone.
It has eight scepters or staves radiating from a common center.
Called also escarbuncle.
