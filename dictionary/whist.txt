Whist, n. Etym: [From Whist, interj.]

Defn: A certain game at cards; -- so called because it requires
silence and close attention. It is played by four persons (those who
sit opposite each other being partners) with a complete pack of
fifty-two cards. Each player has thirteen cards, and when these are
played out, he hand is finished, and the cards are again shuffled and
distributed.

Note: Points are scored for the tricks taken in excess of six, and
for the honors held. In long whist, now seldom played, ten points
make the game; in short whist, now usually played in England, five
points make the game. In American whist, so-called, honors are not
counted, and seven points by tricks make the game.
