TROVER
Tro"ver, n. Etym: [OF. trover, truver, to find, F. trouver; probably
originally, to invent or compose (melodies), fr. (assumed) LL.
tropare. See Troubadour, Trope, and cf. Contrive, Reirieve,
Trouveur.] (Law)
(a) The gaining possession of any goods, whether by finding or by
other means.
(b) An action to recover damages against one who found goods, and
would not deliver them to the owner on demand; an action which lies
in any case to recover the value of goods wrongfully converted by
another to his own use. In this case the finding, though alleged, is
an immaterial fact; the injury lies in the conversion.
