=====
Wort, n. Etym: [OE. worte, wurte, AS. wyrte; akin to OD. wort, G.
würze, bierwürze, Icel. virtr, Sw. vört. See Wort an herb.]

Defn: An infusion of malt which is unfermented, or is in the act of
fermentation; the sweet infusion of malt, which ferments and forms
beer; hence, any similar liquid in a state of incipient fermentation.

Note: Wort consists essentially of a dilute solution of sugar, which
by fermentation produces alcohol and carbon dioxide.
