 -- Nine points circle (Geom.), a circle so related to any given
triangle as to pass through the three points in which the
perpendiculars from the angles of the triangle upon the opposite
sides (or the sides produced) meet the sides. It also passes through
the three middle points of the sides of the triangle and through the
three middle points of those parts of the perpendiculars that are
between their common point of meeting and the angles of the triangle.
The circle is hence called the nine points or six points circle.
