TRAMONTANE
Tra*mon"tane, a. Etym: [OF. tramontain, It. tramontano, L.
transmontanus; trans across, beyond + mons, montis, mountain.]

Defn: Lying or being beyond the mountains; coming from the other side
of the mountains; hence, foreign; barbarous.

Note: The Italians sometimes use this epithet for ultramontane, and
apply it to the countries north of the Alps, as France and Germany,
and especially to their ecclesiastics, jurists, painters, etc.; and a
north wind is called a tramontane wind. The French lawyers call
certain Italian canonists tramontane, or ultramontane, doctors;
considering them as favoring too much the court of Rome. See
Ultramontane.
