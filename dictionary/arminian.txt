Ar*min"i*an, n. (Eccl. Hist.)

Defn: One who holds the tenets of Arminius, a Dutch divine (b. 1560,
d. 1609).

Note: The Arminian doctrines are: 1. Conditional election and
reprobation, in opposition to absolute predestination. 2. Universal
redemption, or that the atonement was made by Christ for all mankind,
though none but believers can be partakers of the benefit. 3. That
man, in order to exercise true faith, must be regenerated and renewed
by the operation of the Holy Spirit, which is the gift of God. 4.
That man may resist divine grace. 5. That man may relapse from a
state of grace.
