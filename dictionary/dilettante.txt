DILETTANTE
Dil`et*tan"te, n.; pl. Dilettanti. Etym: [It., prop. p. pr. of
dillettare to take delight in, fr. L. delectare to delight. See
Delight, v. t.]

Defn: An admirer or lover of the fine arts; popularly, an amateur;
especially, one who follows an art or a branch of knowledge,
desultorily, or for amusement only.

The true poet is not an eccentric creature, not a mere artist living
only for art, not a dreamer or a dilettante, sipping the nectar of
existence, while he keeps aloof from its deeper interests. J. C.
Shairp.
