Defn: That part of a testeator's estate wwhich is not disposed of in
his will by particular and special legacies and devises, and which
remains after payment of debts and legacies.

3. (Chem.)

Defn: That which remains of a molecule after the removal of a portion
of its constituents; hence, an atom or group regarded as a portion of
a molecule; -- used as nearly equivalent to radical, but in a more
general sense.

Note: The term radical is sometimes restricted to groups containing
carbon, the term residue being applied to the others.

4. (Theory of Numbers)

Defn: Any positive or negative number that differs from a given
number by a multiple of a given modulus; thus, if 7 is the modulus,
and 9 the given number, the numbers -5, 2, 16, 23, etc., are
residues.
