especially of those compounds in which cobalt has higher valence; as,
cobaltic oxide. Luteo-cobaltic compounds (Chem.), an extensive series
of complex yellow compounds of ammonia and cobaltic salts.
 -- Roseo-cobaltic compounds (Chem.), an extensive series of complex
red compounds of cobalt and ammonia. Modifications of these are the
