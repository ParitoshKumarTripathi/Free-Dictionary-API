VECTOR
Vec"tor, n. Etym: [L., a bearer, carrier. fr. vehere, vectum, to
carry.]

1. Same as Radius vector.

2. (Math.)

Defn: A directed quantity, as a straight line, a force, or a
velocity. Vectors are said to be equal when their directions are the
same their magnitudes equal. Cf. Scalar.

Note: In a triangle, either side is the vector sum of the other two
sides taken in proper order; the process finding the vector sum of
two or more vectors is vector addition (see under Addition).
