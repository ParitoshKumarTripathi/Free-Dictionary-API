APOLOGUE
Ap"o*logue, n. Etym: [L. apologous, Gr. apologue.]

Defn: A story or relation of fictitious events, intended to convey
some moral truth; a moral fable.

Note: An apologue differs from a parable in this;: the parable is
drawn from events which take place among mankind, and therefore
requires probability in the narrative; the apologue is founded on
supposed actions of brutes or inanimate things, and therefore is not
limited by strict rules of probability. Æsop's fables are good
examples of apologues.
