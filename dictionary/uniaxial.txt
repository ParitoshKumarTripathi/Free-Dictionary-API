UNIAXIAL
U`ni*ax"i*al, a. Etym: [Uni + axial.]

1. (Crystallog.)

Defn: Having but one optic axis, or line of no double refraction.

Note: In uniaxial crystals, the optic axis has the direction of the
vertical crystallographic axis. All tetragonal and hexagonal crystals
are uniaxial.

2. (Biol.)

Defn: Having only one axis; developing along a single line or plane;
-- opposed to multiaxial.
