VERY
Ver"y, a. [Compar. Verier; superl. Veriest.] Etym: [OE. verai,
verray, OF. verai, vrai, F. vrai, (assumed) LL. veracus, for L. verax
true, veracious, fr. verus true; akin to OHG. & OS. war, G. wahr, D.
waar; perhaps originally, that is or exists, and akin to E. was. Cf.
Aver, v. t., Veracious, Verdict, Verity.]

Defn: True; real; actual; veritable.
Whether thou be my very son Esau or not. Gen. xxvii. 21.
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth
a matter separateth very friends. Prov. xvii. 9.
The very essence of truth is plainness and brightness. Milton.
I looked on the consideration of public service or public ornament to
be real and very justice. Burke.

Note: Very is sometimes used to make the word with which it is
connected emphatic, and may then be paraphrased by same, self-same,
itself, and the like. "The very hand, the very words." Shak. "The
very rats instinctively have quit it." Shak. "Yea, there where very
desolation dwells." Milton. Very is used occasionally in the
comparative degree, and more frequently in the superlative. "Was not
my lord the verier wag of the two" Shak. "The veriest hermit in the
nation." Pope. "He had spoken the very truth, and transformed it into
the veriest falsehood." Hawthorne. Very Reverend. See the Note under
Reverend.
