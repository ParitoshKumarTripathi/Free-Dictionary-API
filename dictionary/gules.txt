GULES
Gules, n. Etym: [OE. goules, F. gueules, the same word as gueule
throat, OF. gole, goule, L. gula. So named from the red color of the
throat. See Gullet, and cf. Gula.] (Her.)

Defn: The tincture red, indicated in seals and engraved figures of
escutcheons by parallel vertical lines. Hence, used poetically for a
red color or that which is red.
His sev'n-fold targe a field of gules did stain In which two swords
he bore; his word, "Divide and reign." P. Fletcher.
Follow thy drum; With man's blood paint the ground; gules, gules.
Shak.
Let's march to rest and set in gules, like suns. Beau. & Fl.
