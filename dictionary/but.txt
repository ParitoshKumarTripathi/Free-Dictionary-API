Young.

3. Excepting or excluding the fact that; save that; were it not that;
unless; -- elliptical, for but that.
And but my noble Moor is true of mind . . . it were enough to put him
to ill thinking. Shak.

4. Otherwise than that; that not; -- commonly, after a negative, with
that.

guide her in all her ways. Hooker.

If they kill us, we shall but die. 2 Kings vii. 4.

6. On the contrary; on the other hand; only; yet; still; however;
nevertheless; more; further; -- as connective of sentences or clauses
of a sentence, in a sense more or less exceptive or adversative; as,
the House of Representatives passed the bill, but the Senate
dissented; our wants are many, but quite of another kind.
Now abideth faith hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of
these is charity. 1 Cor. xiii. 13.

Prov. xi. 2.
All but. See under All.
 -- But and if, but if; an attempt on the part of King James's

But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
coming; . . . the lord of that servant will come in a day when he
looketh not for him. Luke xii. 45, 46.
But if, unless. [Obs.] Chaucer.
But this I read, that but if remedy Thou her afford, full shortly I
her dead shall see. Spenser.

Syn.
 -- But, However, Still. These conjunctions mark opposition in
passing from one thought or topic to another. But marks the
opposition with a medium degree of strength; as, this is not winter,
but it is almost as cold; he requested my assistance, but I shall not
aid him at present. However is weaker, and throws the opposition (as
it were) into the background; as, this is not winter; it is, however,
almost as cold; he required my assistance; at present, however, I
shall not afford him aid. The plan, however, is still under
consideration, and may yet be adopted. Still is stronger than but,
and marks the opposition more emphatically; as, your arguments are
weighty; still they do not convince me. See Except, However.

Note: "The chief error with but is to use it where and is enough; an
error springing from the tendency to use strong words without
sufficient occasio,." Bain.
