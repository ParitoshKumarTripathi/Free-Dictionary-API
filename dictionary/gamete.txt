GAMETE
Gam"ete (gam"et; ga*met"; the latter usually in compounds), n. [Gr.
gameth` wife, or game`ths husband, fr. gamei^n to marry.] (Biol.)

Defn: A sexual cell or germ cell; a conjugating cell which unites
with another of like or unlike character to form a new individual. In
Bot., gamete designates esp. the similar sex cells of the lower
thallophytes which unite by conjugation, forming a zygospore. The
gametes of higher plants are of two sorts, sperm (male) and egg
(female); their union is called fertilization, and the resulting
zygote an oöspore. In Zoöl., gamete is most commonly used of the
sexual cells of certain Protozoa, though also extended to the germ
cells of higher forms.
