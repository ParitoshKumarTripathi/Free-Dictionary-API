-- applied by Sir H. Davy to sodium, potassium, and some other
metallic substances whose metallic character was supposed to be not
well defined.
(b) Now, one of several elementary substances which in the free state
are unlike metals, and whose compounds possess or produce acid,
rather than basic, properties; a nonmetal; as, boron, carbon,
phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, chlorine, bromine, etc., are
