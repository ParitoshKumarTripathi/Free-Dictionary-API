SIREDON
Si*re"don, n. Etym: [NL., from Gr. (Zoöl.)

Defn: The larval form of any salamander while it still has external
gills; especially, one of those which, like the axolotl (Amblystoma
Mexicanum), sometimes lay eggs while in this larval state, but which
under more favorable conditions lose their gills and become normal
salamanders. See also Axolotl.
