Am*mo"ni*ac ([or] Gum` am*mo"ni*ac , n. Etym: [L. Ammoniacum, Gr.
Ammon; cf. F. ammoniac. See Ammonite.] (Med.)

Defn: The concrete juice (gum resin) of an umbelliferous plant, the
Dorema ammoniacum. It is brought chiefly from Persia in the form of
yellowish tears, which occur singly, or are aggregated into masses.
It has a peculiar smell, and a nauseous, sweet taste, followed by a
bitter one. It is inflammable, partially soluble in water and in
spirit of wine, and is used in medicine as an expectorant and
resolvent, and for the formation of certain plasters.
