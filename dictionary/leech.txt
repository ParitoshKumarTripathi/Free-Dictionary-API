2. (Zoöl.)

Defn: Any one of numerous genera and species of annulose worms,
belonging to the order Hirudinea, or Bdelloidea, esp. those species
used in medicine, as Hirudo medicinalis of Europe, and allied
species.

Note: In the mouth of bloodsucking leeches are three convergent,
serrated jaws, moved by strong muscles. By the motion of these jaws a
stellate incision is made in the skin, through which the leech sucks
blood till it is gorged, and then drops off. The stomach has large
pouches on each side to hold the blood. The common large bloodsucking
leech of America (Macrobdella decora) is dark olive above, and red
below, with black spots. Many kinds of leeches are parasitic on
fishes; others feed upon worms and mollusks, and have no jaws for
drawing blood. See Bdelloidea. Hirudinea, and Clepsine.

3. (Surg.)

Defn: A glass tube of peculiar construction, adapted for drawing
blood from a scarified part by means of a vacuum. Horse leech, a less
powerful European leech (Hæmopis vorax), commonly attacking the
membrane that lines the inside of the mouth and nostrils of animals
that drink at pools where it lives.
