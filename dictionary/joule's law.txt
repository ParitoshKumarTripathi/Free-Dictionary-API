JOULE'S LAW
Joule's law.

1. (Elec.)

Defn: The law that the rate at which heat is produced in any part of
an electric circuit is measured by the product of the square of the
current into the resistance of that part of the circuit. If the
current
 (i) is constant for an interval of time (t), the energy (H) in heat
units equals i2Rt, R being resistance.

2. (Thermodynamics) The law that there is no change of temperature
when a gas expands without doing external work and without receiving
or rejecting heat.
