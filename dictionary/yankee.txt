YANKEE
Yan"kee, n. Etym: [Commonly considered to be a corrupt pronunciation
of the word English, or of the French word Anglais, by the native
Indians of America. According to Thierry, a corruption of Jankin, a
diminutive of John, and a nickname given to the English colonists of
Connecticut by the Dutch settlers of New York. Dr. W. Gordon ("Hist.
of the Amer. War," ed, 1789, vol. i., pp. 324, 325) says it was a
favorite cant word in Cambridge, Mass., as early as 1713, and that it
meant excellent; as, a yankee good horse, yankee good cider, etc. Cf.
Scot yankie a sharp, clever, and rather bold woman, and Prov. E. bow-
yankees a kind of leggins worn by agricultural laborers.]

Defn: A nickname for a native of citizen of New England, especially
one descended from old New England stock; by extension, an inhabitant
of the Northern States as distinguished from a Southerner; also,
applied sometimes by foreigners to any inhabitant of the United
States.
From meanness first this Portsmouth Yankey rose, And still to
meanness all his conduct flows. Oppression, A poem by an American
(Boston, 1765).
