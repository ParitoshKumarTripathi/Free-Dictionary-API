HYDRODYNAMICS
Hy`dro*dy*nam"ics, n. Etym: [Hydro-, 1 + dynamics: cf. F.
hydrodynamique.]

Defn: That branch of the science of mechanics which relates to
fluids, or, as usually limited, which treats of the laws of motion
and action of nonelastic fluids, whether as investigated
mathematically, or by observation and experiment; the principles of
dynamics, as applied to water and other fluids.

Note: The word is sometimes used as a general term, including both
hydrostatics and hydraulics, together with pneumatics and acoustics.
See Hydraulics.
