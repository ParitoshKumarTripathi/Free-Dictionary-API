=====
Slight, a. [Compar. Slighter; superl. Slightest.] Etym: [OE. sli,
sleght, probably from OD. slicht, slecht, simple, plain, D. slecht;
akin to OFries. sliucht, G. schlecht, schlicht, OHG. sleht smooth,
simple, Icel. sl smooth, Sw. slät, Goth. slaíhts; or uncertain
origin.]

1. Not decidedly marked; not forcible; inconsiderable; unimportant;
insignificant; not severe; weak; gentle; -- applied in a great
variety of circumstances; as, a slight (i. e., feeble) effort; a
slight (i. e., perishable) structure; a slight (i. e., not deep)
impression; a slight (i. e., not convincing) argument; a slight (i.
e., not thorough) examination; slight (i. e., not severe) pain, and
the like. "At one slight bound." Milton.

SLIGHT

=====
Slight, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Slighted; p. pr. & vb. n. Slighting.]

Defn: To disregard, as of little value and unworthy of notice; to
make light of; as, to slight the divine commands. Milton.
The wretch who slights the bounty of the skies. Cowper.
To slight off, to treat slightingly; to drive off; to remove. [R.] --
To slight over, to run over in haste; to perform superficially; to
treat carelessly; as, to slight over a theme. "They will but slight
it over." Bacon.

Syn.
 -- To neglect; disregard; disdain; scorn.
 -- Slight, Neglect. To slight is stronger than to neglect. We may
neglect a duty or person from inconsiderateness, or from being over-
occupied in other concerns. To slight is always a positive and
intentional act, resulting from feelings of dislike or contempt. We
ought to put a kind construction on what appears neglect on the part
of a friend; but when he slights us, it is obvious that he is our
friend no longer.
Beware . . . lest the like befall . . . If they transgress and slight
that sole command. Milton.
This my long-sufferance, and my day of grace, Those who neglect and
scorn shall never taste. Milton.
