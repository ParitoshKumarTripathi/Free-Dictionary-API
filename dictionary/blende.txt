BLENDE
Blende, n. Etym: [G., fr. blenden to blind, dazzle, deceive, fr.
blind blind. So called either in allusion to its dazzling luster; or
(Dana) because, though often resembling galena, it yields no lead.
Cf. Sphalerite.] (Min.)
(a) A mineral, called also sphalerite, and by miners mock lead, false
galena, and black-jack. It is a zinc sulphide, but often contains
some iron. Its color is usually yellow, brown, or black, and its
luster resinous.
(b) A general term for some minerals, chiefly metallic sulphides
which have a somewhat brilliant but nonmetallic luster.
