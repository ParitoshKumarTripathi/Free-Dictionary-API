Defn: Making a circuit of the year of the seasons; recurring in each
quarter of the year; as, ember fasts.

Ember days (R. C. & Eng. Ch.), days set apart for fasting and prayer
in each of the four seasons of the year. The Council of Placentia [A.
D. 1095] appointed for ember days the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday
after the first Sunday in Lent, Whitsuntide, the 14th of September,
and the 13th of December. The weeks in which these days fall are
called ember weeks.
