DUNCE
Dunce, n. Etym: [From Joannes Duns Scotus, a schoolman called the
Subtle Doctor, who died in 1308. Originally in the phrase "a Duns
man". See Note below.]

Defn: One backward in book learning; a child or other person dull or
weak in intellect; a dullard; a dolt.
I never knew this town without dunces of figure. Swift.

Note: The schoolmen were often called, after their great leader Duns
Scotus, Dunsmen or Duncemen. In the revival of learning they were
violently opposed to classical studies; hence, the name of Dunce was
applied with scorn and contempt to an opposer of learning, or to one
slow at learning, a dullard.
