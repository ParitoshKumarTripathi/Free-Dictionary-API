wiersa, wyrsa, a comparative with no corresponding positive; akin to
OS. wirsa, OFries. wirra, OHG. wirsiro, Icel. verri, Sw. värre, Dan.
värre, Goth. waírsiza, and probably to OHG. werran to bring into

no comparative and superlative, worse and worst are used in lieu of
them, although etymologically they have no relation to bad.]

evil; less good; specifically, in poorer health; more sick; -- used
both in a physical and moral sense.
