CRUSTACEA
Crus*ta"ce*a (krs-t"sh-), n. pl. Etym: [Neut. pl. of NL. crustaceus
pert. to the crust or shell, from L. crusta the hard surfsce of a
body, rind, shell.] (Zo√∂l.)

Defn: One of the classes of the arthropods, including lobsters and
crabs; -- so called from the crustlike shell with which they are
covered.

Note: The body usually consists of an anterior part, made up of the
head and thorax combined, called the cephalothorax, and of a
posterior jointed part called the abdomen, postabdomen, and
(improperly) tail. They breathe by means of gills variously attached
to some of the limbs or to the sides the body, according to the
group. They are divisible into two subclasses, Entomostraca and
Malacostraca, each of which includes several orders.
