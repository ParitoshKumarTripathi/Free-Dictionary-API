Tur*quoise", Tur*quois", n. Etym: [F. turquoise; cf. Pr. & Sp.
turquesa, It. turchese, turchina, LL. turchesius, turchina; -- so
called because first brought from Turkey. See 1st Turkey.] (Min.)

Defn: A hydrous phosphate of alumina containing a little copper;
calaite. It has a blue, or bluish green, color, and usually occurs in
reniform masses with a botryoidal surface. [Formerly written also
turcois, and turkois.]

Note: Turquoise is susceptible of a high polish, and when of a bright
blue color is much esteemed as a gem. The finest specimens come from
Persia. It is also found in New Mexico and Arizona, and is regarded
as identical with the chalchihuitl of the Mexicans.
