PRELATE
Prel"ate (; 48), n. Etym: [F. pr√©lat, LL. praelatus, fr. L.
praelatus, used as p. p. of praeferre to prefer, but from a different
root. See Elate.]

Defn: A clergyman of a superior order, as an archbishop or a bishop,
having authority over the lower clergy; a dignitary of the church.

Note: This word and the words derived from it are often used
invidiously, in English ecclesiastical history, by dissenters,
respecting the Established Church system.
Hear him but reason in divinity, . . . You would desire the king were
made a prelate. Shak.
