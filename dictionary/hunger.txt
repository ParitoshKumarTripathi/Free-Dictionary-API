Hun"ger, n. Etym: [AS. hungor; akin to OFries. hunger, D. honger, OS.
& OHG. hungar, G. hunger, Icel. hungr, Sw. & Dan. hunger, Goth. h
hunger, huggrjan to hunger.]

1. An uneasy sensation occasioned normally by the want of food; a
craving or desire for food.

Note: The sensation of hunger is usually referred to the stomach, but
is probably dependent on excitation of the sensory nerves, both of
the stomach and intestines, and perhaps also on indirect impressions
from other organs, more or less exhausted from lack of nutriment.

2. Any strong eager desire.
O sacred hunger of ambitious minds! Spenser.
For hunger of my gold I die. Dryden.
