2. (Math.)

Defn: The sum of a series of products of several numbers, these
products being formed according to certain specified laws; thus, the
determinant of the nine numbers. a, b, c,a', b', c',a'\'b7, b'\'b7,
c'\'b7, is a b' c'\'b7 -- a b'\'b7 c' + a' b'\'b7 c] -- a' b c'\'b7 +
a'\'b7 b' c. The determinant is written by placing the numbers from
which it is formed in a square between two vertical lines. The theory
of determinants forms a very important branch of modern mathematics.

3. (Logic)

Defn: A mark or attribute, attached to the subject or predicate,
narrowing the extent of both, but rendering them more definite and
precise. Abp. Thomson.
