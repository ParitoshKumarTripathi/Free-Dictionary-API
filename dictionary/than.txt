than, then, AS. thanne, thonne, th\'91nne; akin to D. dan, OHG.
danne, G. dann then, denn than, for, Goth. Þan then, and to E. the,

Defn: A particle expressing comparison, used after certain adjectives
and adverbs which express comparison or diversity, as more, better,
other, otherwise, and the like. It is usually followed by the object
compared in the nominative case. Sometimes, however, the object
compared is placed in the objective case, and than is then considered
by some grammarians as a preposition. Sometimes the object is
expressed in a sentence, usually introduced by that; as, I would
rather suffer than that you should want.
Behold, a greater than Solomon is here. Matt. xii. 42.
Which when Beelzebub perceived, than whom, Satan except, none higher
sat. Milton.
It's wiser being good than bad; It's safer being meek than fierce;
It's fitter being sane than mad. R. Browning.
