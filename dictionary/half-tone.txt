HALF-TONE
Half"-tone`, a.

Defn: Having, consisting of, or pertaining to, half tones; specif.
(Photo-engraving),

Defn: pertaining to or designating plates, processes, or the pictures
made by them, in which gradation of tone in the photograph is
reproduced by a graduated system of dotted and checkered spots,
usually nearly invisible to the unaided eye, produced by the
interposition between the camera and the object of a screen. The name
alludes to the fact that this process was the first that was
practically successful in reproducing the half tones of the
photograph.
