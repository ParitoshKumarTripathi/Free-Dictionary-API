VERSE
Verse, n. Etym: [OE. vers, AS. fers, L. versus a line in writing,
and, in poetry, a verse, from vertere, versum, to turn, to turn
round; akin to E. worth to become: cf. F. vers. See Worth to become,
and cf. Advertise, Averse, Controversy, Convert, Divers, Invert,
Obverse, Prose, Suzerain, Vortex.]

1. A line consisting of a certain number of metrical feet (see Foot,
n., 9) disposed according to metrical rules.

Note: Verses are of various kinds, as hexameter, pentameter,
tetrameter, etc., according to the number of feet in each. A verse of
twelve syllables is called an Alexandrine. Two or more verses form a
stanza or strophe.

2. Metrical arrangement and language; that which is composed in
metrical form; versification; poetry.
Such prompt eloquence Flowed from their lips in prose or numerous
verse. Milton.
Virtue was taught in verse. Prior.
Verse embalms virtue. Donne.

3. A short division of any composition. Specifically: --
(a) A stanza; a stave; as, a hymn of four verses.

Note: Although this use of verse is common, it is objectionable,
because not always distinguishable from the stricter use in the sense
of a line.
(b) (Script.) One of the short divisions of the chapters in the Old
and New Testaments.

Note: The author of the division of the Old Testament into verses is
not ascertained. The New Testament was divided into verses by Robert
Stephens [or Estienne], a French printer. This arrangement appeared
for the first time in an edition printed at Geneva, in 1551.
(c) (Mus.) A portion of an anthem to be performed by a single voice
to each part.

4. A piece of poetry. "This verse be thine." Pope. Blank verse,
poetry in which the lines do not end in rhymes.
 -- Heroic verse. See under Heroic.
