SAP
Sap, n. Etym: [AS. sæp; akin to OHG. saf, G. saft, Icel. safi; of
uncertain origin; possibly akin to L. sapere to taste, to be wise,
sapa must or new wine boiled thick. Cf. Sapid, Sapient.]

1. The juice of plants of any kind, especially the ascending and
descending juices or circulating fluid essential to nutrition.

Note: The ascending is the crude sap, the assimilation of which takes
place in the leaves, when it becomes the elaborated sap suited to the
growth of the plant.

2. The sapwood, or alburnum, of a tree.

3. A simpleton; a saphead; a milksop. [Slang] Sap ball (Bot.), any
large fungus of the genus Polyporus. See Polyporus.
 -- Sap green, a dull light green pigment prepared from the juice of
the ripe berries of the Rhamnus catharticus, or buckthorn. It is used
especially by water-color artists.
 -- Sap rot, the dry rot. See under Dry.
 -- Sap sucker (Zoöl.), any one of several species of small American
woodpeckers of the genus Sphyrapicus, especially the yellow-bellied
woodpecker (S. varius) of the Eastern United States. They are so
named because they puncture the bark of trees and feed upon the sap.
The name is loosely applied to other woodpeckers.
 -- Sap tube (Bot.), a vessel that conveys sap.
