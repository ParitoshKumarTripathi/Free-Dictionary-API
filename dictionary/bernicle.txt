Ber"ni*cle, n. Etym: [OE. bernak, bernacle; cf. OF. bernac; prob. fr.
LL. bernacula for hibernicula, bernicula, fr. Hibernia; the birds
coming from Hibernia or Ireland. Cf. 1st Barnacle.]

Defn: A bernicle goose. [Written also barnacle.] Bernicle goose
(Zo√∂l.), a goose (Branta leucopsis), of Arctic Europe and America. It
was formerly believed that it hatched from the cirripeds of the sea
(Lepas), which were, therefore, called barnacles, goose barnacles, or
Anatifers. The name is also applied to other related species. See
Anatifa and Cirripedia.
