DATARIA
Da*ta"ri*a, n. Etym: [LL., fr. L. datum given.] (R. C. Ch.)

Defn: Formerly, a part of the Roman chancery; now, a separate office
from which are sent graces or favors, cognizable in foro externo,
such as appointments to benefices. The name is derived from the word
datum, given or dated (with the indications of the time and place of
granting the gift or favor).
