GENTILE
Gen"tile, n. Etym: [L. gentilis belonging to the same clan, stock,
race, people, or nation; in opposition to Roman, a foreigner; in
opposition to Jew or Christian, a heathen: cf. F. gentil. See Gentle,
a.]

Defn: One of a non-Jewish nation; one neither a Jew nor a Christian;
a worshiper of false gods; a heathen.

Note: The Hebrews included in the term goyim, or nations, all the
tribes of men who had not received the true faith, and were not
circumcised. The Christians translated goyim by the L. gentes, and
imitated the Jews in giving the name gentiles to all nations who were
neither Jews nor Christians. In civil affairs, the denomination was
given to all nations who were not Romans.

 -- Pagan; heathen. See Pagan.
