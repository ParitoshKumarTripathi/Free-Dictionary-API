CANTER
Can"ter, n. Etym: [An abbreviation of Caner bury. See Canterbury
gallop, under Canterbury.]

1. A moderate and easy gallop adapted to pleasure riding.

Note: The canter is a thoroughly artificial pace, at first extremely
tiring to the horse, and generally only to be produced in him by the
restraint of a powerful bit, which compels him to throw a great part
of his weight on his haunches . . . There is so great a variety in
the mode adopted by different horses for performing the canter, that
no single description will suffice, nor indeed is it easy . . . to
define any one of them. J. H. Walsh.

2. A rapid or easy passing over.
A rapid canter in the Times over all the topics. Sir J. Stephen.
