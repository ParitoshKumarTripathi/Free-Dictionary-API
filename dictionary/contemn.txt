and is applied especially to objects, qualities, etc., which are
deemed contemptible, and but rarely to individuals; to despise is to
regard or treat as mean, unbecoming, or worthless; to scorn is
stronger, expressing a quick, indignant contempt; disdain is still
stronger, denoting either unwarrantable pride and haughtiness or an
abhorrence of what is base.
