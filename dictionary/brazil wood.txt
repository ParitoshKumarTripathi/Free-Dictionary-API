BRAZIL WOOD
Bra*zil" wood`. Etym: [OE. brasil, LL. brasile (cf. Pg. & Sp. brasil,
Pr. bresil, Pr. bresil); perh. from Sp. or Pg. brasa a live coal (cf.
Braze, Brasier); or Ar. vars plant for dyeing red or yellow. This
name was given to the wood from its color; and it is said that King
Emanuel, of Portugal, gave the name Brazil to the country in South
America on account of its producing this wood.]

1. The wood of the oriental Cæsalpinia Sapan; -- so called before the
discovery of America.

2. A very heavy wood of a reddish color, imported from Brazil and
other tropical countries, for cabinet-work, and for dyeing. The best
is the heartwood of Cæsalpinia echinata, a leguminous tree; but other
trees also yield it. An interior sort comes from Jamaica, the timber
of C. Braziliensis and C. crista. This is often distinguished as
Braziletto , but the better kind is also frequently so named.
