Syn. -- To disprove; overthrow; sed aside; refute; oppugn. -- To
Confute, Refute. Refute is literally to and decisive evidence; as, to
refute a calumny, charge, etc. Confute is literally to check boiling,
as when cold water is poured into hot, thus serving to allay, bring
down, or neutralize completely. Hence, as applied to arguments (and
the word is never applied, like refute, to charges), it denotes, to
overwhelm by evidence which puts an end to the case and leaves an
opponent nothing to say; to silence; as, "the atheist is confuted by
the whole structure of things around him."
