NERVE
Nerve, n. Etym: [OE. nerfe, F. nerf, L. nervus, akin to Gr. needle.
Cf. Neuralgia.]

1. (Anat.)

Defn: One of the whitish and elastic bundles of fibers, with the
accompanying tissues, which transmit nervous impulses between nerve
centers and various parts of the animal body.

Note: An ordinary nerve is made up of several bundles of nerve
fibers, each bundle inclosed in a special sheath (the perineurium)
and all bound together in a connective tissue sheath and framework
(the epineurium) containing blood vessels and lymphatics.

2. A sinew or a tendon. Pope.

3. Physical force or steadiness; muscular power and control;
constitutional vigor.
he led me on to mightiest deeds, Above the nerve of mortal arm.
Milton.

4. Steadiness and firmness of mind; self-command in personal danger,
or under suffering; unshaken courage and endurance; coolness; pluck;
resolution.

5. Audacity; assurance. [Slang]

6. (Bot.)

Defn: One of the principal fibrovascular bundles or ribs of a leaf,
especially when these extend straight from the base or the midrib of
the leaf.

7. (Zoöl.)

Defn: One of the nervures, or veins, in the wings of insects. Nerve
cell (Anat.), one of the nucleated cells with which nerve fibers are
connected; a ganglion cell.
 -- Nerve fiber (Anat.), one of the fibers of which nerves are made
up. These fibers are either medullated or nonmedullated. in both
kinds the essential part is the translucent threadlike axis cylinder
which is continuous the whole length of the fiber.
 -- Nerve stretching (Med.), the operation of stretching a nerve in
order to remedy diseases such as tetanus, which are supposed to be
influenced by the condition of the nerve or its connections.
