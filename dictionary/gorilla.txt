GORILLA
Go*ril"la, n. Etym: [An African word; found in a Greek translation of
a treatise in Punic by Hanno, a Carthaginian.] (Zoöl.)

Defn: A large, arboreal, anthropoid ape of West Africa. It is larger
than a man, and is remarkable for its massive skeleton and powerful
muscles, which give it enormous strength. In some respects its
anatomy, more than that of any other ape, except the chimpanzee,
resembles that of man.
