ACOUSTICS
A*cous"tics (#; 277), n. Etym: [Names of sciences in -ics, as,
acoustics, mathematics, etc., are usually treated as singular. See -
ics.] (Physics.)

Defn: The science of sounds, teaching their nature, phenomena, and
laws.
Acoustics, then, or the science of sound, is a very considerable
branch of physics. Sir J. Herschel.

Note: The science is, by some writers, divided, into diacoustics,
which explains the properties of sounds coming directly from the ear;
and catacoustica, which treats of reflected sounds or echoes.
