a discipline in callousness. Whatever sympathies exist are seared. H.
Spencer.

Note: Sear is allied to scorch in signification; but it is applied
primarily to animal flesh, and has special reference to the effect of
heat in marking the surface hard. Scorch is applied to flesh, cloth,
or any other substance, and has no reference to the effect of
hardness. To sear, to close by searing. "Cherish veins of good humor,
and sear up those of ill." Sir W. Temple.
