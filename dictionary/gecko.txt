GECKO
Geck"o, n.; pl. Geckoes. Etym: [Cf. F. & G. gecko; -- so called from
the sound which the animal utters.] (Zoöl.)

Defn: Any lizard of the family Geckonidæ. The geckoes are small,
carnivorous, mostly nocturnal animals with large eyes and vertical,
elliptical pupils. Their toes are generally expanded, and furnished
with adhesive disks, by which they can run over walls and ceilings.
They are numerous in warm countries, and a few species are found in
Europe and the United States. See Wall gecko, Fanfoot.
