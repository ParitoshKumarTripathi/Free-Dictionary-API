EBONY
Eb"on*y, n.; pl. Ebonies. Etym: [F. ébène, L. ebenus, fr. Gr. hobnim,
pl. Cf. Ebon.]

Defn: A hard, heavy, and durable wood, which admits of a fine polish
or gloss. The usual color is black, but it also occurs red or green.

Note: The finest black ebony is the heartwood of Diospyros
reticulata, of the Mauritius. Other species of the same genus (D.
Ebenum, Melanoxylon, etc.), furnish the ebony of the East Indies and
Ceylon. The West Indian green ebony is from a leguminous tree (Brya
Ebenus), and from the Excæcaria glandulosa.
