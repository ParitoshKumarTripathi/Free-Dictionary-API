TITTLE
Tit"tle, n. Etym: [OE. titel, titil, apparently a dim. of tit, in the
sense of small; cf. G. t√ºttel a tittle, dim. of OHG. tutta teat.
Perhaps, however, the same word as title, n.]

Defn: A particle; a minute part; a jot; an iota.
It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law
to fail. Luke xvi. 17.
