THINE
Thine, pron. & a. Etym: [OE. thin, AS. edhin, originally gen. of
edhu, edhu, thou; akin to G. dein thine, Icel. þinn, possessive
pron., þin, gen. of þu thou, Goth. þeins, possessive pron., þeina,
gen. of þu thou. See Thou, and cf. Thy.]

Defn: A form of the possessive case of the pronoun thou, now
superseded in common discourse by your, the possessive of you, but
maintaining a place in solemn discourse, in poetry, and in the usual
language of the Friends, or Quakers.

Note: In the old style, thine was commonly shortened to thi (thy)
when used attributively before words beginning with a consonant; now,
thy is used also before vowels. Thine is often used absolutely, the
thing possessed being understood.
