TEETOTUM
Tee*to"tum, n. Etym: [For T-totum. It was used for playing games of
chance, and was four-sided, one side having the letter T on it,
standing for Latin totum all, meaning, take all that is staked,
whence the name. The other three sides each had a letter indicating
an English or Latin word; as P meaning put down, N nothing or L. nil,
H half. See Total.]

Defn: A child's toy, somewhat resembling a top, and twirled by the
fingers.
The staggerings of the gentleman . . . were like those of a teetotum
nearly spent. Dickens.
