RASPBERRY
Rasp"ber*ry, n, Etym: [From E. rasp, in allusion to the apparent
roughness of the fruit.] (Bot.)
(a) The thimble-shaped fruit of the Rubus Idæus and other similar
brambles; as, the black, the red and the white raspberry.
(b) The shrub bearing this fruit.

Note: Technically, raspberries are those brambles in which the fruit
separates readily from the core or receptacle, in this differing from
the blackberries, in which the fruit is firmly attached to the
receptacle.
