There are many species. They have a sack of inklike fluid which they
discharge from the siphon tube, when pursued or alarmed, in order to
confuse their enemies. Their shell is a thin horny plate, within the
flesh of back, shaped very much like a quill pen. In America they are
called squids. See Squid.
