ROCKAWAY
Rock"a*way, Etym: [Probably from Rockaway beach, where it was used.]

Defn: Formerly, a light, low, four-wheeled carriage, with standing
top, open at the sides, but having waterproof curtains which could be
let down when occasion required; now, a somewhat similar, but
heavier, carriage, inclosed, except in front, and having a door at
each side.
