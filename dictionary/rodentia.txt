RODENTIA
Ro*den"ti*a, n. pl. Etym: [NL. See Rodent, a.] (Zo√∂l.)

Defn: An order of mammals having two (rarely four) large incisor
teeth in each jaw, distant from the molar teeth. The rats, squirrels,
rabbits, marmots, and beavers belong to this order.

Note: The incisor teeth are long, curved, and strongly enameled on
the outside, so as to keep a cutting edge. They have a persistent
pulp and grow continuously.
