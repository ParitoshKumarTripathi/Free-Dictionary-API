PSEUDOSPHERE
Pseu"do*sphere`, n. Etym: [Pseudo- + sphere.] (Geom.)

Defn: The surface of constant negative curvature generated by the
revolution of a tractrix. This surface corresponds in non-Euclidian
space to the sphere in ordinary space. An important property of the
surface is that any figure drawn upon it can be displaced in any way
without tearing it or altering in size any of its elements.
