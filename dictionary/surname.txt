SURNAME
Sur"name`, n. Etym: [Pref. sur + name; really a substitution for OE.
sournoun, from F. surnom. See Sur-, and Noun, Name.]

1. A name or appellation which is added to, or over and above, the
baptismal or Christian name, and becomes a family name.

Note: Surnames originally designated occupation, estate, place of
residence, or some particular thing or event that related to the
person; thus, Edmund Ironsides; Robert Smith, or the smith; William
Turner. Surnames are often also patronymics; as, John Johnson.

2. An appellation added to the original name; an agnomen. "My
surname, Coriolanus." Shak.

Note: This word has been sometimes written sirname, as if it
signified sire-name, or the name derived from one's father.
