TRIGONOMETRIC; TRIGONOMETRICAL
Trig`o*no*met"ric, Trig`o*no*met"ric*al,Etym: [Cf. F.
trigonométrique.]

Defn: Of or pertaining to trigonometry; performed by the rules of
trigonometry. --Trig`o*no*met"ric*al*ly, adv. Trigonometrical curve,
a curve one of whose coördinates is a trigonometric function of the
other.
 -- Trigonometrical function. See under Function.
 -- Trigonometrical lines, lines which are employed in solving the
different cases of plane and spherical trigonometry, as sines,
tangents, secants, and the like. These lines, or the lengths of them,
are trigonometrical functions of the arcs and angles to which they
belong.
