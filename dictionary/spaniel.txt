1. (Zoöl.)

Defn: One of a breed of small dogs having long and thick hair and
large drooping ears. The legs are usually strongly feathered, and the
tail bushy. See Illust. under Clumber, and Cocker.

Note: There are several varieties of spaniels, some of which, known
as field spaniels, are used in hunting; others are used for toy or
pet dogs, as the Blenheim spaniel, and the King Charles spaniel (see
under Blenheim). Of the field spaniels, the larger kinds are called
springers, and to these belong the Sussex, Norfolk, and Clumber
spaniels (see Clumber). The smaller field spaniels, used in hunting
woodcock, are called cocker spaniels (see Cocker). Field spaniels are
remarkable for their activity and intelligence.
